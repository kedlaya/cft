      In <xref ref="sec_ideles-cohom1"/>, we proved that for <m>L/K</m> a cyclic extension of number fields,
      the Herbrand quotient <m>h(C_L)</m> of the id&#xe8;le class group of <m>L</m> is equal to <m>[L:K]</m> (<xref ref="T_first_inequality1"/>)
      and deduced that <m>\#H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), C_L) \geq [L:K]</m> (the <q>First Inequality</q>; <xref ref="T_first_inequality"/>).
      This time we'll prove the reverse inequality, and even a somewhat stronger statement (see <xref ref="T_first_and_second_inequality"/> below).
    </p>
    <p>
      For this step, we have no local analogue to draw upon: the corresponding assertion in local class field theory is covered by Theorem 90 (<xref ref="L_theorem_90"/>).
      Unfortunately, there seems to be no direct approach to computing either <m>H^{-1}_T(\Gal(L/K), C_L)</m> or <m>H^1(\Gal(L/K), C_L)</m>, so some alternate strategy is needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We take an analytic approach motivated by the proof of Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions; see <xref ref="L_second_inequality_analytic"/>. There is also an algebraic approach, but we prefer to postpone discussing it
      until we are ready to tackle the existence theorem, as these two topics share similar ideas; see <xref ref="T_first_and_second_inequality_algebraic"/>.

    <title>Back to ideals</title>
    <p>
      For the analytic proof, we need to recast the Second Inequality back into classical,
      ideal-theoretic language. In this argument, there is no need to assume that <m>L/K</m> is cyclic.
    </p>

      <p>
        Let <m>L/K</m> be a finite Galois extension and <m>\gothm</m> a formal product of places of <m>K</m>.
        As in <xref ref="def-generalized-ideal-class-groups"/>, let <m>J^{\gothm}_K</m> be the group of fractional ideals of <m>K</m> coprime to <m>\gothm</m>;
        similarly, let <m>J^{\gothm}_L</m> be the group of fractional ideals of <m>L</m> coprime to <m>\gothm</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>I^{\gothm}_K</m> be the subset of <m>\alpha \in I_K</m> such that:
        <ol>
          <li>
            for each finite prime <m>\gothp</m> of <m>K</m>, <m>\alpha_v \equiv 1 \pmod{\gothp^e}</m> where <m>e</m> is the exponent of <m>\gothp</m> in <m>\gothm</m>;
          </li>
          <li>
            for each real place <m>v</m> in <m>\gothm</m>, <m>\alpha_v &gt; 0</m>.
          </li>

        Define <m>I^{\gothm}_L</m> similarly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>P^{\gothm}_K</m> be the subgroup of <m>J^{\gothm}_K</m> consisting of principal ideals admitting a generator <m>\alpha \in K^* \cap I^{\gothm}_L</m>; 
        define <m>P^{\gothm}_L</m> similarly. In this notation,
        <me>
          \Cl^{\gothm}(K) = J^{\gothm}_K/P^{\gothm}_K, \qquad \Cl^{\gothm}(L) = J^{\gothm}_L / P^{\gothm}_L

      <p>
        The homomorphism <m>I_K \to J_K</m> from <xref ref="def-ideles-to-ideals-hom"/> restricts to a homomorphism
        <m>I_K^{\gothm} \to J_K^{\gothm}</m>, which in turn induces a surjective homomorphism <m>I_K^{\gothm}/(K^* \cap I_K^{\gothm}) \to \Cl^{\gothm}(K)</m>.
        On the other hand, as indicated in <xref ref="rmk-open-subgroup-idele"/>, we have <m>K^* I_K^{\gothm} = I_K</m> and hence 
        <m>I_K^{\gothm}/(K^* \cap I_K^{\gothm}) \cong C_K</m>, yielding a surjection <m>C_K \to \Cl^{\gothm}(K)</m>.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-norm-quotient-classical">
      <statement>
        <p>
          With notation as in <xref ref="def-second-inequality-analytic"/>, the composition
          <me>
            C_K / \Norm_{L/K} C_L \cong I_K^{\gothm}/(K^* \Norm_{L/K} I_L^{\gothm}) \to J^{\gothm}_K / P^{\gothm}_{K} \Norm_{L/K} J^{\gothm}_L
          </me>
          is an isomorphism for some <m>\gothm</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The map in question is surjective because <m>I_K^{\gothm} \to J_K^{\gothm}</m> is; we thus need to check injectivity for suitable <m>\gothm</m>.
          Let <m>S</m> be the set of finite places of <m>K</m> which ramify in <m>L</m>.
          For each <m>v \in S</m>, apply local class field theory (see <xref ref="T_local_existence"/>) to see that 
          for <m>w</m> a place of <m>L</m> above <m>v</m>, the image of <m>\Norm_{L_w/K_v} L_w^*</m>
          is an open subgroup <m>U_v</m> of <m>K_v^*</m> of finite index. We may then choose <m>\gothm</m> to include every real place and each place in <m>S</m>,
          and to ensure that for each <m>v \in S</m>, <m>(I_K^{\gothm})_v \subseteq U_v</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We now prove the claim for such a choice of <m>\gothm</m>. Given an element of <m>I_K^{\gothm}</m> whose image in <m>J^{\gothm}_K</m> belongs to 
          <m>P^{\gothm}_{K} \Norm_{L/K} J^{\gothm}_L</m>, we can factor it as an element of <m>K^* \cap I_K^{\gothm}</m> times an element of <m>\Norm_{L/K} I_L^{\gothm}</m>
          times an element <m>\alpha \in I_K^{\gothm}</m> such that for each finite place <m>v</m>, <m>\alpha_v \in \gotho_{K_v}^*</m>.
          We see that <m>\alpha \in \Norm_{L/K} I_L^{\gothm}</m> by looking separately at real places (which are okay because these places appear in <m>\gothm</m>),
          complex places (which are okay for trivial reasons), finite places in <m>S</m> (which are okay by our choice of <m>\gothm</m>), and finite places not in <m>S</m>
          (which are okay because these places are unramified in <m>L</m>).
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <p>
      With <xref ref="lem-norm-quotient-classical"/> in hand, we can reduce the Second Inequality to proving that
      <me>
        [J^{\gothm}_K : P^{\gothm}_{K} \Norm_{L/K} J^{\gothm}_L] \leq [L:K]

    <title>A special case of Chebotaryov density</title>
    <p>
      We will need a special case of the Chebotaryov density theorem,
      which fortunately we can prove without already having all of class field theory.
      We use the notion of <term>Dirichlet density</term> for sets of prime ideals in a number field; see <xref ref="def-dirichlet-density"/>
      and the remainder of the discussion in <xref ref="sec_zeta"/>.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-splitting-primes-density">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L</m> be a finite extension of <m>K</m> and let <m>M/K</m> be its Galois closure.
          Then the set <m>S</m> of prime ideals of <m>K</m> that split completely in <m>L</m> has Dirichlet density <m>\frac{1}{[M:K]}</m>
          (in the sense of <xref ref="def-dirichlet-density"/>).
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          A prime of <m>K</m> splits completely in <m>L</m> if and only if it splits completely in <m>M</m>,
          so we may assume <m>L=M</m> is Galois.
          Recall that the set <m>T</m> of unramified primes <m>\gothq</m> of <m>L</m> of absolute degree 1 has Dirichlet density 1
          (see <xref ref="exc-density-1"/> and <xref ref="exc-density-split-1"/>);
          each such prime lies over an unramified prime <m>\gothp</m> of <m>K</m> of absolute degree 1 which splits completely in <m>L</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The set <m>T</m> having Dirichlet density 1 means that
          <me>
            \sum_{\gothq \in T} \frac{1}{\Norm(\gothq)^s} \sim \frac{1}{s-1} \qquad s \to 1^-
          </me>.
          If we group the primes in <m>T</m> by which prime of <m>S</m> they lie over,
          then we get
          <me>
            [L:K] \sum_{\gothp \in T} \frac{1}{\Norm(\gothp)^s} \sim \frac{1}{s-1} \qquad s \to 1^-
          </me>.
          That is, the Dirichlet density of <m>S</m> is <m>\frac{1}{[L:K]}</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <example>
      <p>
        For <m>L/\QQ</m> a quadratic extension, <xref ref="prop-splitting-primes-density"/> states that the set of prime ideals of <m>\QQ</m>
        that split completely in <m>L</m> has Dirichlet density <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>. As this splitting is governed by a congruence condition thanks to quadratic
        reciprocity, this assertion also follows from Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions.

    <title>The Second Inequality</title>
    <p>
      We are now ready to prove the Second Inequality.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="L_second_inequality_analytic">
      <statement>
        <p>
          With notation as in <xref ref="def-second-inequality-analytic"/>, we have
          <me>
            [J^{\gothm}_K : P^{\gothm}_K \Norm_{L/K} J^{\gothm}_{L}] \leq [L:K]
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Define the group 
          <me>
            H := P^{\gothm}_K \Norm_{L/K} J^{\gothm}_L \subseteq J^{\gothm}_K
          </me>.
          The group <m>H</m> includes every prime of <m>K</m> that splits completely,
          since such a prime is the norm of any prime of <m>L</m> lying over it;
          thus on one hand, by <xref ref="prop-splitting-primes-density"/> the set of primes in <m>H</m> has Dirichlet density at least <m>\frac{1}{[L:K]}</m>.
          On the other hand, by Dirichlet's theorem for number fields (<xref ref="rmk-dirichlet-for-number-fields"/>),
          the same set has density <m>\frac{1}{[J^{\gothm}_K:H]}</m>.
          We conclude that <m>[J^{\gothm}_K:H] \leq [L:K]</m>, as desired.

      </proof>

    <corollary xml:id="C_second_inequality_analytic">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L/K</m> be a Galois extension of number fields. Then

          This follows from <xref ref="L_second_inequality_analytic"/> by translating back into the language of id&#xe8;les using <xref ref="lem-norm-quotient-classical"/>.

    </corollary>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-H0T-bound-analytic">
      <p>
        We do not consider <xref ref="C_second_inequality_analytic"/> to be a component of the Second Inequality because it is not needed in order to verify
        the class field axiom (and we will not reproduce it in the algebraic approach). In fact, once we complete the proofs of the reciprocity law 
        (<xref ref="T_adelic_reciprocity_law"/>) and the norm limitation theorem (<xref ref="T_adelic_norm_limitation1"/>),
        <xref ref="C_second_inequality_analytic"/> will also follow from those two statements together.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, if one wants to avoid abstract class field theory, then it is helpful to have <xref ref="C_second_inequality_analytic"/> in hand.

    <theorem xml:id="T_first_and_second_inequality">
      <title>Second Inequality</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L/K</m> be a Galois extension of number fields.
          Then:

      <proof>
        <p>
          For <m>L/K</m> cyclic, combining <xref ref="C_second_inequality_analytic"/> with the periodicity of Tate groups
          (<xref ref="T_cyclic_group_periodicity"/>) shows that <m>\#H^2(\Gal(L/K), C_L) \leq [L:K]</m>. Combining with the First Inequality
          (<xref ref="T_first_inequality"/>) yields that <m>H^1(\Gal(L/K), C_L)</m> is trivial and <m>\#H^2(\Gal(L/K), C_L) = [L:K]</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For <m>L/K</m> solvable, we may proceed by induction on <m>[L:K]</m>. If <m>[L:K]</m> is not cyclic, choose an intermediate subextension
          <m>K'/K</m> . By the induction hypothesis, <m>H^1(\Gal(L/K'), C_{K'})</m> vanishes,
          so we may apply the inflation-restriction exact sequence (<xref ref="C_inflation_restriction_h2"/>) to see that for <m>i=1,2</m>,
          <me>
            0 \to H^i(\Gal(K'/K), C_{K'}) \stackrel{\Inf}{\to} H^i(\Gal(L/K), C_L) \stackrel{\Res}{\to} H^i(\Gal(L/K'), C_L)
          </me>
          is exact. This allows us to complete the induction.
        </p>
        <p>
          For <m>L/K</m> general, put <m>G = \Gal(L/K)</m>, let <m>p</m> be a prime, and let <m>G_p</m> be a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>.
          Then for any <m>i&gt;0</m>, <m>H^i(G,C_L)</m> is killed by the order of <m>G</m> and
          <me>
            \Res\colon H^i(G, C_L) \to H^i(G_p, C_L)
          </me>
          is injective on <m>p</m>-primary components (both by the relationship between restriction and corestriction, from <xref ref="exa-extended-functoriality"/>).
          Since <m>G_p</m> is solvable, we may deduce both assertions from the solvable case.

    <title>Aside: the Hasse norm theorem</title>
    <p>
    We record a byproduct of the Second Inequality (not needed in what follows).
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_Hasse_norm">
      <title>Hasse norm theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L/K</m> be a cyclic extension of number fields. Then an element <m>x \in K^*</m> belongs to <m>\Norm_{L/K} L^*</m>
          if and only if for each (finite or infinite) place <m>v</m> of <m>K</m>, for some (and hence every) place <m>w</m> of <m>L</m> lying over <m>K</m>,

      <proof>
        <p>
          By the Second Inequality (<xref ref="T_first_and_second_inequality"/>), <m>H^{-1}_T(G, C_L) = 1</m>.
          This implies that <m>H^0_T(G, L^*) \to H^0_T(G, I_L)</m> is injective. Now if <m>x \in K^*</m> belongs to 
          <m>\Norm_{L_w/K_v} L_w^*</m>. then it defines the zero class in <m>H^0_T(G, I_L)</m>, so by the previous logic 
          it must also define the zero class in <m>H^0_T(G, L^*)</m>; this proves the claim.

      <p>
        The conclusion of <xref ref="T_Hasse_norm"/> fails completely if <m>L/K</m> is abelian but not cyclic. See <xref ref="exer-Hasse_norm_theorem"/>.

    </remark>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-Grunwald-Wang">
      <p>
        Another related fact is the <term>Grunwald-Wang theorem</term>. 
        It was originally announced (and published) in an incorrect form by Grunwald <xref ref="bib-Grunwald"/>, 
        who asserted that
        for <m>K</m> a number field and <m>n</m> a positive integer, an element <m>x \in K^*</m> is an <m>n</m>-th power if and only if it is an <m>n</m>-th power in <m>K_v</m>
        for all but finitely many places <m>v</m> of <m>K</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It was then shown by Wang <xref ref="bib-Wang"/> that this statement fails in the following way: 
        the element 16 is an <m>8</m>th power in <m>K_v</m> for any place <m>v</m>
        not lying above <m>2</m> (see <xref ref="exer-Wang"/>) but need not be an <m>8</m>th power in <m>K</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, Wang <xref ref="bib-Wang2"/> established a corrected version of the theorem, which shows that the original statement is <q>nearly</q> true.
        For example, it holds as written whenever <m>n</m> is odd.
