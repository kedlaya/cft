      we have now computed that <m>H^1(L/K) = 0</m>

    <title>Cup products in cohomology and Tate groups</title>
    <p>
      We first describe cup products, which will give rise to the map in Tate's theorem (<xref ref="T_tate_thm1"/>).
      See also <xref ref="bib-Milne-CFT"/>, Proposition II.1.38.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-cup-product">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> be a finite group. Let <m>M,N</m> be <m>G</m>-modules.
          Then there are canonical bilinear maps
          <me>
            \bullet \cup \bullet \colon H^i(G,M) \times H^j(G, N) \to H^{i+j}(G, M \otimes_\ZZ N)
          </me>
          and
          <me>
            \bullet \cup \bullet \colon H^i_T(G,M) \times H^j_T(G, N) \to H^{i+j}_T(G, M \otimes_\ZZ N)
          </me>
          which are functorial in each argument, and compatible with long exact sequences in each argument.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We first treat the case of cohomology groups.
          Without loss of generality suppose that <m>M</m> is torsion-free.
          When <m>i = 0</m>, for any <m>m \in H^0(G,M) = M^G</m>, 
          <m>n \mapsto m \otimes n</m> is a homomorphism of <m>G</m>-modules; we thus get maps 
          <m>H^j(G,N) \to H^j(G, M \otimes_\ZZ N)</m> which are functorial in <m>N</m> and compatible with long exact sequences
          (here we are using that <m>M</m> is torsion-free and hence flat over <m>\ZZ</m>).
          For <m>i \gt 0</m>, we perform dimension shifting on <m>M</m> using the sequence
          <me>
            0 \to M \to \Ind^G_1 \Res^G_1 M \to M' \to 0
          </me>
          from <xref ref="P_adjoint_property"/>; recall that this sequence splits (<xref ref="rem-coh-finite-mod"/>),
          so it remains exact upon tensoring with <m>N</m>.
          Note also that we need to check functoriality and compatibility with long exact sequences in <m>M</m>; we leave this to the reader.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the Tate groups, we automatically have the claim when <m>i,j \gt 0</m> from the case of cohomology groups.
          We can then dimension shift downward, using sequences of the form
          <me>
            0 \to M' \to \Ind^G_1 \Res^G_1 \to M \to 0
          </me>
          as in <xref ref="P_adjoint_property"/> (which splits at the level of <m>\ZZ</m>-modules), 
          to deduce the claim for smaller indices.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <remark xml:id="rem-cup-product-properties">
      <p>
        See <xref ref="bib-Milne-CFT"/>, Proposition I.1.39 for more properties of the cup product, which are again proved by starting in degree 0 and then using dimension shifting.
        One of these is skew-symmetry: 
        <me>
          x \cup y = (-1)^{ij} y \cup x \qquad (x \in H^i_T(G, M), y \in H^j_T(G,N))
        </me>.
        Another is compatibility with restriction:
        <me>
          \Res(x \cup y) = \Res(x) \cup \Res(y)
        </me>.

    <title>Tate's theorem</title>
    <p>
      We next prove Tate's theorem (<xref ref="T_tate_thm1"/>). Note that right now, we only need this for solvable groups because every finite Galois extension of local fields
      has solvable Galois group (<xref ref="rmk-local-galois-solvable"/>); this allows for some simplification in the arguments. 
      However, we will do the extra work to handle the general case for later use in the global setting.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="L_tate_thm_lemma">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> be a finite group and <m>M</m> a <m>G</m>-module.
          Suppose that <m>H^i(H,\Res^G_H M) =0</m> for <m>i=1,2</m> and <m>H</m> any subgroup of <m>G</m>
          (including <m>G</m> itself).
          Then <m>H^i_T(G,M) = 0</m> for all <m>i \in \ZZ</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let us first check that <m>H^i_T(G,M) = 0</m> for all <m>i \geq 0</m>.
          For <m>G</m> cyclic, this follows by periodicity (<xref ref="T_cyclic_group_periodicity"/>) from the hypothesis that <m>H^1(G,M) = H^2(G,M) = 0</m>.
          In fact this even yields vanishing for <m>i \lt 0</m>, but we will not be able to carry that through the following steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          For <m>G</m> solvable, we prove that <m>H^i_T(G,M) = 0</m> for all <m>i \geq 0</m> by induction on <m>\#G</m> as follows.
          The trivial group serves as a trivial base case.
          Since <m>G</m> is solvable, if it is not the trivial group then
          it has a proper subgroup <m>H</m> for which <m>G/H</m> is cyclic.
          By the induction hypothesis, <m>H^i_T(H,\Res^G_H M) = 0</m> for all <m>i \geq 0</m>.
          Thus by the inflation-restriction exact sequence (<xref ref="P_inflation_restriction"/>),
          <me>
            0 \to H^i(G/H, M^H) \to H^i(G, M) \to H^i(H, \Res^G_H M)
          </me>
          is exact for all <m>i \gt 0</m>; the term on the end being zero,
          we have <m>H^i(G/H, M^H) \cong H^i(G,M) = 0</m> for <m>i=1, 2</m>.
          By periodicity again, <m>H^i_T(G/H, M^H) = 0</m> for all <m>i \in \ZZ</m>,
          so <m>H^i(G/H, M^H) = 0</m> for all <m>i>0</m>, and so <m>H^i(G,M) = 0</m> for <m>i \gt 0</m>.
          For <m>i=0</m>, the vanishing of <m>H^0_T(G/H, M^H)</m> means that every <m>x \in M^G = (M^H)^{G/H}</m>
          can be written in the form <m>\Norm_{G/H}(y)</m> for some <m>y \in M^H</m>,
          and the vanishing of <m>H^0_T(H, \Res^G_H M)</m> means that <m>y</m> can in turn be written in the form
          <m>\Norm_H(z)</m> for some <m>z \in M</m>; we thus have <m>x = \Norm_G (z)</m> and so <m>H^0_T(G, M) = 0</m>.
         </p>
        <p>
          For <m>G</m> arbitrary, we prove that <m>H^i_T(G,M) = 0</m> for all <m>i \geq 0</m> by induction on <m>\#G</m> as follows.
          For <m>i \geq 0</m>, we already know that the group <m>H^i_T(G,M)</m> is killed by <m>\#G</m> (apply <xref ref="exa-extended-functoriality"/> for <m>i \gt 0</m>
          and check directly for <m>i = 0</m>),
          so it suffices to show that its <m>p</m>-primary component vanishes for any prime <m>p</m> dividing <m>\#G</m>.
          To check this, let <m>G_p</m> be any Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>.
          For <m>i \gt 0</m>,
          as per <xref ref="exa-extended-functoriality"/> again,
          the composition 
          <me>
            H^i(G, M) \stackrel{\Res}{\to} H^i(G_p, \Res^G_{G_p} M) \stackrel{\Cor}{\to} H^i(G, M)
          </me>
          is multiplication by the integer <m>[G:G_p]</m> which is prime to <m>p</m>; consequently, <m>\Res</m> induces an injective map on
          <m>p</m>-primary components. Since <m>G_p</m> is solvable and the <m>G_p</m>-module <m>\Res^G_{G_p} M</m> satisfies the vanishing hypothesis,
          we can apply the previous paragraph to deduce that <m>H^i(G_p, \Res^G_{G_p} M) = 0</m>, and hence <m>H^i(G,M) = 0</m>.
          For <m>i=0</m>, the vanishing of <m>H^0_T(G_p, \Res^G_{G_p} M)</m> means that every <m>x \in M^G</m>
          can be written in the form <m>\Norm_{G_p}(y)</m>, and so <m>[G:G_p]x = \Norm_G(y)</m>; hence the <m>p</m>-primary part of <m>H^0_T(G, M)</m> also vanishes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we treat the case <m>i \lt 0</m> by dimension shifting.
          We proceed by induction: we will show that if the claim holds for all <m>i \geq -n</m> for some nonnegative integer <m>n</m>,
          then the claim also holds for all <m>i \geq -n-1</m>.
          To this end, make the exact sequence
          <me>
            0 \to N \to \Ind^G_1 \Res^G_1 M \to M \to 0
          </me>
          in which <m>m \otimes [g]</m> maps to <m>m^g</m> (from the proof of <xref ref="P_adjoint_property"/>).
          For any subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>G</m>, the term in the middle is acyclic with respect to <m>H</m>
          (see <xref ref="def-induced-module"/>).
          From the long exact sequence, we obtain <m>H^{i+1}_T(H, \Res^G_H N) \cong H^{i}_T(H, \Res^G_H M)</m> for all <m>i \in \ZZ</m>.
          In particular, since we already know that <m>H^i_T(H, \Res^G_H M) = 0</m> for all <m>i \geq -n</m>,
          we deduce that <m>H^i_T(H, \Res^G_H N) = 0</m> for all <m>i \geq -n+1</m>, and in particular for <m>i=1,2</m>.
          We may thus apply the induction hypothesis to deduce that <m>H^i_T(G, N) = 0</m> for <m>i \geq -n</m>.
          Turning this around, we deduce that <m>H^i_T(G, M) = 0</m> for <m>i \geq -n-1</m>.

      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <theorem xml:id="T_tate_thm2">
      <title>Tate</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> be a finite group and let <m>M</m> be a <m>G</m>-module.
          Suppose that for all subgroups <m>H</m> of <m>G</m>
          (including <m>G</m> itself),
          <m>H^1(H,\Res^G_H M)=0</m> and <m>H^2(H,\Res^G_H M)</m> is cyclic of order <m>\#H</m>.
          Then for any generator <m>\gamma</m> of <m>H^2(G,M) = H^2_T(G,M)</m> and any <m>i \in \ZZ</m>,
          the cup product map

            \gamma \cup \bullet \colon H^i_T(G, \ZZ) \to H^{i+2}_T(G, M)
          </me>
          is an isomorphism.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Since <m>\Cor \circ \Res = [G:H]</m> (<xref ref="exa-extended-functoriality"/>),
          <m>\Res(\gamma)</m> generates <m>H^2(H,\Res^G_H M)</m> for any <m>H</m>.
          We start out by explicitly constructing a <m>G</m>-module containing <m>M</m> in which <m>\gamma</m> becomes a coboundary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Choose a 2-cocycle <m>\phi\colon G^3 \to M</m> representing <m>\gamma</m>;
          by the definition of a cocycle,
          <md>
            <mrow>\phi(g_0 g, g_1 g, g_2 g) = \phi(g_0, g_1, g_2)^g</mrow>,
            <mrow>\phi(g_1, g_2, g_3) - \phi(g_0, g_2, g_3) + \phi(g_0, g_1, g_3) - \phi(g_0, g_1, g_2) = 0</mrow>
          </md>.
          Moreover, <m>\phi</m> is a coboundary if and only if it is of the form <m>d(\rho)</m>, that is,
          <m>\phi(g_0, g_1, g_2) = \rho(g_1, g_2) - \rho(g_0, g_2) + \rho(g_0, g_1)</m>.
          This <m>\rho</m> must itself be <m>G</m>-invariant:
          <m>\rho(g_0, g_1)^g = \rho(g_0g, g_1g)</m>.
          Thus <m>\phi</m> is a coboundary if and only if
          <me>
            \phi(e, g, hg) = \rho(e,h)^g - \rho(e,hg) + \rho(e,g)
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>M[\phi]</m> be the direct sum of <m>M</m> with the free abelian group with one generator <m>x_g</m> for each element <m>g</m> of
          <m>G - \{e\}</m>, with the <m>G</m>-action
          <me>
            x_h^g = x_{hg} - x_g + \phi(e, g, hg)
          </me>.
          (The symbol <m>x_e</m> should be interpreted as the element
          <m>\phi(e,e,e)</m> of <m>M</m>.) Using the cocycle property of <m>\phi</m>,
          one may verify that this is indeed a <m>G</m>-action;
          by construction, the cocycle <m>\phi</m> becomes zero in
          <m>H^2(G, M[\phi])</m> by setting <m>\rho(e,g) = x_g</m>.
          (Milne calls <m>M[\phi]</m> the <term>splitting module</term> of <m>\phi</m>.)
          Moreover, by the same token, for any <m>H</m>, the restriction of <m>\phi</m> to <m>H</m> also becomes zero in <m>H^2(H, \Res^G_H M[\phi])</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The map <m>\alpha\colon M[\phi] \to \ZZ[G]</m> sending <m>M</m> to zero and <m>x_g</m> to <m>[g]-1</m> is a homomorphism of <m>G</m>-modules.
          Actually it maps into the augmentation ideal <m>I_G</m>,
          and the sequence
          <me>
            0 \to M \to M[\phi] \to I_G \to 0
          </me>
          is exact. Meanwhile, we also have the usual exact sequence
          <me>
            0 \to I_G \to \ZZ[G] \to \ZZ \to 0
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For any subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>G</m>,
          we can restrict to <m>H</m>-modules (which we leave out of the notation for brevity),
          then take the long exact sequence. 
          In the second case, since <m>\ZZ[G]</m> is induced (for <m>G</m> and hence for <m>H</m>),
          its Tate groups all vanish and we get a dimension shift:
          <md>
            <mrow>
              H^1(H, I_G) &amp;\cong H^0_T(H, \ZZ) = \ZZ/(\#H)\ZZ
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              H^2(H, I_G) &amp;\cong H^1(H, \ZZ) = 0
            </mrow>
          </md>.
          In the first case, we get
          <md>
            <mrow>
              0 = H^1(H, M) \to H^1(H, M[\phi]) \to H^1(H, I_G)

            <mrow>
              \to H^2(H, M) \to H^2(H, M[\phi]) \to H^2(H, I_G) = 0
            </mrow>
          </md>.
          Moreover, the map into <m>H^2(H, M[\phi])</m> vanishes by construction,
          so in fact <m>H^2(H, M[\phi]) = 0</m>.
          Now <m>H^1(H, I_G) \to H^2(H,M)</m> is a surjective map between two finite (even cyclic) groups of the same order <m>\#H</m>,
          so the map is also injective and <m>H^1(H, M[\phi]) = 0</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may now apply <xref ref="L_tate_thm_lemma"/> to conclude that <m>H^i_T(G, M[\phi]) = 0</m> for all <m>i</m>.
          This allows us to use the four-term exact sequence
          <me>
            0 \to M \to M[\phi] \to \ZZ[G] \to \ZZ \to 0
          </me>
          (as in the proof of <xref ref="T_cyclic_group_periodicity"/>) to obtain the dimension-shifting isomorphism

        In a similar vein, we can use cup products to give a different description of the periodicity isomorphism <m>H^i_T(G,M) \to H^{i+2}(G,M)</m>
        when <m>G</m> is cyclic: it is the cup product with the class in <m>H^2_T(G, \ZZ)</m> arising via the connecting homomorphism from the class in

          H^i_T(\Gal(L/K), \ZZ) \to H^{i+2}_T(L/K)
        </me>.
        In particular, we get an isomorphism
        <men xml:id="eq-reciprocity-isom-from-cohomology">
          K^*/\Norm_{L/K} L^* = H^0_T(L/K) \to H^{-2}_T(\Gal(L/K), \ZZ) = \Gal(L/K)^{\ab}
        </men>.
        This immediately yields the the norm limitation theorem
        (<xref ref="T_norm_limitation"/>): if <m>M/K</m> is the maximal abelian subextension of <m>L/K</m>, then
        <m>\Norm_{L/K} L^* \subseteq \Norm_{M/K} M^*</m> but both have the same finite index in <m>K^*</m>, and so must be equal.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make the previous isomorphism canonical, we use the canonical isomorphism <m>H^2(L/K) \cong \frac{1}{[L:K]}\ZZ/\ZZ</m>
        from <xref ref="P_local_h2"/> to specify that our preferred generator of <m>H^2(L/K)</m> is the one corresponding to <m>\frac{1}{[L:K]}</m>.
        We thus deduce <xref ref="T_cup_product_isomorphism"/>.

        From <xref ref="rem-assemble-local-reciprocity"/>, we immediately deduce the Galois case of the norm limitation theorem 
        (<xref ref="T_norm_limitation"/>): if <m>L/K</m> is a Galois extension of local fields and <m>M/K</m> is the maximal abelian subextension of <m>L/K</m>, then
        <m>\Norm_{L/K} L^* \subseteq \Norm_{M/K} M^*</m> but both have the same finite index in <m>K^*</m>, and so must be equal.        
      </p>
      <p>
        For <m>L/K</m> not necessarily Galois, we can reduce to the previous case as follows. The inclusion <m>\Norm_{L/K} L^* \subseteq \Norm_{M/K} M^*</m> remains evident,
        so we must check the reverse inclusion <m>\Norm_{M/K} M^* \subseteq \Norm_{L/K} L^*</m>; this may be checked after enlarging <m>L</m> in such a way as to preserve <m>M</m>.
        In particular we may replace <m>L</m> with its Galois closure, in which case the previous argument applies.

        As for the existence of the local reciprocity map (<xref ref="T_local_reciprocity"/>),
        we are not quite there yet: we have isomorphisms as in <xref ref="eq-reciprocity-isom-from-cohomology"/> for every <m>L/K</m>,
        but we still need to verify that the maps defined for various <m>L</m> over a fixed <m>K</m> fit together.
        Note that since we have the norm limitation theorem in hand, we need only check this compatibility for

        We address the issue by reformulating the local reciprocity map to avoid mixing cohomology and homology groups.

        and the cup product pairing
        <me>
          H^{-2}_T(G, \ZZ) \times H^2_T(G, \ZZ) \to H^0_T(G, \ZZ)

      <p>
        This means that we can give an alternate description of the local reciprocity isomorphism: the cup product pairing
        <me>
          H^0_T(L/K) \times H^2_T(\Gal(L/K), \ZZ) \to H^2_T(L/K) \stackrel{\inv_{L/K}}{\to} \QQ/\ZZ
        </me>
        is also nondegenerate. If we precompose with the map <m>H^0(L/K) \to H^0_T(L/K)</m>, then everything is in terms of cohomology
        groups rather than Tate groups, so we can calculate more explicitly, as in <xref ref="L_local_recip_map_alt"/>.
        Even more importantly, we now have extended functoriality available (<xref ref="exa-extended-functoriality"/>):
        if <m>M/K</m> is a subextension of <m>L/K</m>, then the cup product pairing is compatible with the restriction maps
        <m>H^i(\Gal(L/K), *) \to H^i(\Gal(M/K), *)</m> (see <xref ref="rem-cup-product-properties"/>), 
        as are the invariant maps <m>\inv_{L/K}</m> and <m>\inv_{M/K}</m>
        (by <xref ref="P_local_h2"/>). This allows us to conclude that the local reciprocity maps collate to a single map
        <m>K^* \to \Gal(\overline{K}/K)^{\ab}</m>, completing the proof of <xref ref="T_local_reciprocity"/>.

      <p>
        Alternatively, one can use the explicit proof of the existence theorem given by Lubin-Tate theory to make the calculation

    <title>The local existence theorem</title>
    <p>
      We next address the local existence theorem (<xref ref="T_local_existence"/>). This does not follow directly from cohomological considerations;
      instead we need to construct some extensions with small norm groups. Fortunately, since we have already established the norm limitation theorem,
      we do not need to construct <em>abelian</em> extensions; this will give us some flexibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      We begin with a lemma,
      in which we take advantage of Kummer theory to establish a special case of the existence theorem.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="L_hilbert_symbol">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\ell</m> be a prime number.
          Let <m>K</m> be a local field containing a primitive <m>\ell</m>-th root of unity.
          Then <m>x \in K^*</m> is an <m>\ell</m>-th power in <m>K</m> if and only if belongs to
          <m>\Norm_{L/K} L^*</m> for every cyclic extension <m>L</m> of <m>K</m> of degree <m>\ell</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>M</m> be the compositum of all cyclic <m>\ell</m>-extensions of <m>K</m>.
          The group <m>K^*/(K^*)^{\ell}</m> is finite (<xref ref="exer-finite-power-quotient"/>),
          and hence is isomorphic to <m>(\ZZ/\ell \ZZ)^n</m> for some positive integer <m>n</m>.
          By Kummer theory (<xref ref="T_Kummer_reformulated"/>), we also have <m>\Gal(M/K) \cong (\ZZ/\ell \ZZ)^n</m>.
          By the local reciprocity isomorphism (in the form obtained in <xref ref="rem-assemble-local-reciprocity"/>), 
          <m>K^*/\Norm_{M/K}M^* \cong (\ZZ/\ell \ZZ)^n</m>;
          consequently, on one hand <m>(K^*)^{\ell} \subseteq \Norm_{M/K}M^*</m>,
          and on other hand these subgroups of <m>K^*</m> have the same index <m>\ell^n</m>.
          They are thus equal, proving the claim.

    <remark xml:id="rmk-Hilbert-symbol">

        The conclusion of <xref ref="L_hilbert_symbol"/> remains true even if <m>\ell</m> is not prime; see <xref ref="exer-hilbert-symbol"/>.

          then <m>x</m> is an <m>\ell</m>-th power in <m>K^*</m>.

          Apply <xref ref="L_hilbert_symbol"/> to the field <m>K(\zeta_\ell)</m> 
          obtained by adjoining a primitive <m>\ell</m>-th root of unity to <m>K</m>:
          this tells us that <m>x</m> becomes an <m>\ell</m>-th power in <m>K(\zeta_\ell)^*</m>.
          By taking norms back to <m>K</m>, we deduce that <m>x^{[K(\zeta_\ell):K]}</m> is an <m>\ell</m>-th power in <m>K^*</m>; since
          <m>[K(\zeta_\ell):K]</m> divides <m>\ell-1</m>, it is coprime to <m>\ell</m>, and so we deduce that <m>x \in (K^*)^\ell</m>.

    <corollary xml:id="C_universal_norms_divisible">

        <p>
          Let <m>K</m> be a local field of characteristic <m>0</m>.
          Then the intersection of the groups <m>\Norm_{L/K} L^*</m> for all finite extensions <m>L</m> of <m>K</m> is the trivial group.

          Let <m>D_K</m> be the intersection in question;
          note that <m>D_K \subseteq \gotho_K^*</m> by considering unramified extensions of <m>K</m>,
          so <m>D_K</m> is in particular a compact topological group.
          By <xref ref="L_universal_norm_is_power"/>, for every prime <m>\ell</m>, every element of <m>D_K</m> is the <m>\ell</m>-th power of an element of <m>D_K</m>
          we will show that in fact every element of <m>D_K</m> is the <m>\ell</m>-th power of an element of <m>D_K</m> itself.
          This will show that <m>D_K</m> is a divisible abelian group, and in particular every element is an <m>n</m>-th power for every positive integer <m>n</m>;
          it will then follow from <xref ref="exer-finite-power-intersection"/> that <m>D_K</m> is the trivial group.
          (Alternatively, one can follow the suggestion of <xref ref="rmk-Hilbert-symbol"/> and prove that the conclusion of <xref ref="L_hilbert_symbol"/>
          retains true when <m>\ell</m> is replaced by an arbitrary positive integer <m>n</m>, and then apply <xref ref="exer-finite-power-intersection"/> directly.)
        </p>
        <p>
          We first need to verify something which might seem obvious but isn't quite: for <m>L/K</m> a finite extension, 
          <me>
            \Norm_{L/K} D_L = D_K
          </me>.
          This isn't obvious because for <m>x \in D_K</m>, for each 
          individual finite extension <m>M</m> of <m>K</m> we can write <m>x = \Norm_{M/K}(z)</m> for some <m>z \in M^*</m>, but it is not apparent that we can force the elements
          <m>y = \Norm_{M/L}(z)</m> to all be equal. 
          It is nonetheless true because, for any given <m>M</m> the set of such <m>y</m> is a nonempty compact subset of <m>U_L</m>, and any finite
          intersection of these subsets is nonempty (because we can pass to a large enough field to contain all of the <m>M</m> in question and bring an element from there);
          so the whole intersection is nonempty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let <m>\ell</m> be a prime and choose <m>x \in D_K</m>. For each finite extension <m>L</m> of <m>K</m> containing a primitive <m>\ell</m>-th root of unity,
          let <m>E(L)</m> be the set of <m>\ell</m>-th roots of <m>x</m> in <m>K</m> which belong to <m>\Norm_{L/K} L^*</m>. This set is finite (of cardinality at most <m>\ell</m>)
          and nonempty: we have <m>x = \Norm_{L/K}(y)</m> for some <m>y \in D_L</m> by the previous paragraph, so <m>y</m> has an <m>\ell</m>-th root <m>z</m> in <m>L</m> and
          <m>\Norm_{L/K}(z) \in E(L)</m>. By the previous paragraph, <m>E(M) \subseteq E(L)</m> whenever <m>L \subseteq M</m>, so we may again conclude using the finite intersection
          property. Alternatively, just note that if each of the (finitely many!) elements of <m>E(K)</m> fails to survive to some larger field, we can take a compositum to get
          a single field <m>L</m> such that no element of <m>E(K)</m> belongs to <m>E(L)</m>, which is absurd since <m>E(L) \neq \emptyset</m>.

          <em>not necessarily abelian</em>, such that <m>\Norm_{L/K}L^* \subseteq U</m>.
          This will give us a useful amount of flexibility in what follows.

          Let <m>m\ZZ \subseteq \ZZ</m> be the image of <m>U</m> in <m>K^*/\gotho_K^* \cong \ZZ</m>;
          by choosing <m>L</m> to contain the unramified extension of <m>K</m> of degree <m>m</m>,

          <m>\Norm_{L/K} L^*</m> in <m>K^*/\gotho_K^*</m> is also contained in <m>m\ZZ</m>.
          It thus remains to further ensure that

          Since <m>\gotho_K^*</m> is compact,

          the intersection of the groups <m>(\Norm_{L/K} L^*) \cap \gotho_K^*</m> is trivial;

          we then have <m>\Gal(M/K) \cong K^*/\Norm_{M/K}M^*</m>.
          Now take <m>L</m> to be the fixed field of the subgroup of <m>\Gal(M/K)</m> corresponding to <m>U/\Norm_{M/K}M^*</m>;
          using <xref ref="rem-assemble-local-reciprocity-compatibility"/>, we see that this has the desired effect.

      <exercise xml:id="exer-abelian-subgroup-as-product">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>G</m> be a finite abelian group and let <m>H</m> be a subgroup of <m>G</m>. Prove that there exists a representation of <m>G</m>
            as a product of cyclic groups <m>C_1 \times \cdots \times C_m</m> of prime power order in such a way that <m>H</m> is itself equal to 
            <m>C'_1 \times \cdots \times C'_m</m> for some subgroups <m>C'_i</m> of <m>C_i</m>.

      <exercise xml:id="exer-finite-power-quotient">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Prove that for any local field <m>K</m> and any positive integer <m>n</m> not divisible by the characteristic of <m>K</m>,
            the group <m>K^*/(K^*)^{n}</m> is finite.

      <exercise xml:id="exer-finite-power-intersection">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Prove that for any local field <m>K</m> of characteristic <m>0</m>,
            the intersection of the groups <m>(K^*)^n</m> over all positive integers <m>n</m> is the trivial group.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            First get the intersection into <m>\gotho_K^*</m>,
            then use prime-to-<m>p</m> exponents to get it into the 1-units,
            then use powers of <m>p</m> to finish.
            The last step is the only one which fails in characteristic <m>p</m>.

      <exercise xml:id="exer-hilbert-symbol">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Extend <xref ref="L_hilbert_symbol"/>
            to the case where <m>\ell</m> is an arbitrary positive integer,
            not necessarily prime.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            It may help to use the structure theorem for finite abelian groups.
