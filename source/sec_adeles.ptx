    <title>Lattices of number fields</title>
    <p>
      The basic idea is that we want some sort of <q>global completion</q> of a number field <m>K</m>.
      Let us first recall an older version of this idea: Minkowski's construction of the Euclidean lattice associated to a number field.
      We follow <xref ref="bib-Neukirch"/>, I.5.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-Minkowski-lattice">
      <p>
        Let <m>K</m> be a number field of degree <m>n</m>. It then has <m>n</m> distinct embeddings <m>\tau\colon K \to \CC</m>.
        The product embedding
        <me>
          j\colon K \to \prod_\tau \CC, \qquad a \mapsto (\tau(a))_\tau
        </me>
        induces an isomorphism of <m>K_{\CC} = K \otimes_{\QQ} \CC</m> with <m>\prod_\tau \CC</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ring <m>K_{\CC} = K \otimes_{\QQ} \CC</m> admits an involution <m>F</m> which fixes <m>K</m> and acts on <m>\CC</m> via complex conjugation.
        The corresponding action on <m>\prod_\tau \CC</m> is
        <me>
          (z_\tau)_\tau \mapsto (\overline{z_{\overline{\tau}}})_\tau
        </me>
        where <m>\overline{\tau}</m> denotes the composition of <m>\tau</m> with complex conjugation on <m>\CC</m>. The fixed subring under <m>F</m>
        is <m>K_{\RR} = K \otimes_{\QQ} \RR</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Equip <m>K_\CC \cong \prod_\tau \CC</m> with the standard Hermitian inner product, that is,
        <me>
          \langle z_1, z_2 \rangle = \sum_\tau z_{1,\tau} \overline{z_{2,\tau}}
        </me>.
        This restricts to a positive definite inner product on <m>K_\RR</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Via the embedding of <m>K</m> into <m>K_\RR</m>, <m>\gotho_K</m> corresponds to a <term>lattice</term> in <m>K_\RR</m>, i.e., a discrete cocompact subgroup.
        Similarly, any fractional ideal of <m>K</m> corresponds to a lattice in <m>K_\RR</m>.

    <title>Profinite completions</title>
    <p>
      Let us put aside the Minkowski construction for the moment and turn to some more arithmetic considerations.
      We have already used in multiple places the fact that the profinite completion <m>\widehat{\ZZ}</m> of the group <m>\ZZ</m>
      can be identified, via the Chinese remainder theorem, with the product <m>\prod_p \ZZ_p</m>. This generalizes to an arbitrary
      number field as follows.
    </p>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-group-quotient-is-ring">
      <p>
        Before continuing, we should clarify our use of notation like <m>\widehat{\gotho_K}</m> to denote the profinite completion of
        <m>\gotho_K</m> for <m>K</m> a number field. We originally defined this as an inverse limit over finite <em>group</em> quotients of 
        <m>\gotho_K</m>. However, remember that we can define the same inverse limit using any smaller collection of quotients which is <term>cofinal</term>
        (that is, any finite quotient factors through some chosen quotient). In particular, if <m>G</m> is a subgroup of <m>\gotho_K</m> of some finite index <m>n</m>,
        then <m>n \gotho_K \subseteq G</m> and so the quotient map <m>\gotho_K \to \gotho_K/G</m> factors through the ring quotient <m>\gotho_K/n\gotho_K</m>.
        That is, <m>\widehat{\gotho_K}</m> can be identified with the inverse limit <m>\varprojlim_n \gotho_K/n\gotho_K</m>,
        and hence also carries the structure of a topological ring.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-number-ring-completion">
      <statement>
        For <m>K</m> a number field, there is a natural isomorphism of compact topological rings
        <me>
          \widehat{\gotho_K} \to \prod_{\gothp} \varprojlim_m \gotho_K/\gothp^m
        </me>
        where <m>\gothp</m> runs over (nonzero) prime ideals of <m>\gotho_K</m>.
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          As in <xref ref="rmk-group-quotient-is-ring"/>, we identify <m>\widehat{\gotho_K}</m> with <m>\varprojlim_n \gotho_K/n\gotho_K</m>. This ring maps
          to <m>\gotho_K/\gothp^m</m> for each prime <m>\gothp</m> and each positive integer <m>m</m>; putting these maps together gives us a map
          <m>\widehat{\gotho_K} \to \varprojlim_m \gotho_K/\gothp^m</m> for each <m>\gothp</m>, and hence a map to the product.
        </p>
        <p>
          To see that this map is a bijection, factor the ideal <m>n \gotho_K</m> as <m>\gothp_1^{e_1} \cdots \gothp_r^{e_r}</m> for some primes
          <m>\gothp_1,\dots,\gothp_r</m> and some positive integers <m>e_1,\dots,e_r</m>. By the Chinese remainder theorem for ideals in a Dedekind domain,
          the natural map
          <me>
            \gotho_K/n\gotho_K \to \prod_{i=1}^r \gotho_K/\gothp_i^{e_i}
          </me>
          is an isomorphism. This immediately implies that the original map is injective. To see that the original map is surjective, we must also observe that for
          each prime <m>\gothp</m> and each positive integer <m>m</m>, there exists a positive integer <m>n</m> such that <m>n \gotho_K</m> is divisible by <m>\gothp^m</m>;
          for instance, we may take <m>n</m> to be the absolute norm of <m>\gothp^m</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <remark>
      <p>
        We cannot help mentioning a variant of <xref ref="rmk-group-quotient-is-ring"/> that plays a key role in <m>p</m>-adic Hodge theory.
        Let <m>\CC_p</m> be a completed algebraic closure of <m>\QQ_p</m>. Consider the inverse system
        <me>
          \cdots \stackrel{x \mapsto x^p}{\to} \gotho_{\CC_p} \stackrel{x \mapsto x^p}{\to} \gotho_{\CC_p}
        </me>.
        Since the maps are multiplicative but not additive, the inverse limit only appears to carry the structure of a multiplicative monoid.
        However, it was originally observed by Fontaine that the natural map from this inverse system to the inverse system
        <me>
          \cdots \stackrel{x \mapsto x^p}{\to} \gotho_{\CC_p}/p\gotho_{\CC_p} \stackrel{x \mapsto x^p}{\to} \gotho_{\CC_p}/p\gotho_{\CC_p}
        </me>
        is an isomorphism. In this inverse system, the maps upgrade to ring homomorphisms because <m>(x+y)^p = x^p + y^p</m> in any ring
        in which <m>p=0</m>; consequently, the original inverse limit is upgraded to a ring! This then implies that the inverse limit of the system
        <me>
          \cdots \stackrel{x \mapsto x^p}{\to} \CC_p \stackrel{x \mapsto x^p}{\to} \CC_p
        </me>
        is again a ring; it is in fact an algebraically closed field which is complete with respect to a certain nonarchimedean absolute value.
        This construction has come to be known as forming the <term>tilt</term> of <m>\CC_p</m>, and generalizes to a large class of fields
        which are complete with respect to nonarchimedean absolute values (the <term>perfectoid fields</term>). See <xref ref="bib-AWS"/> for an introduction
        to this circle of ideas.

    <title>The ad&#xe8;les (rational case)</title>
    <p>
      Our next step is to put the Minkowski construction together with profinite completion to define the ring of ad&#xe8;les.
      Let us do this first in the case of the rational numbers.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        We define the <term>ring of finite ad&#xe8;les</term>
        <m>\AA^{\fin}_\QQ</m> as any of the following isomorphic objects:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              the tensor product <m>\widehat{\ZZ} \otimes_{\ZZ} \QQ</m>;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              the direct limit of <m>\frac{1}{n} \widehat{\ZZ}</m> over all nonzero integers <m>n</m>;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              the <term>restricted direct product</term>
              <m>\sideset{}{'_p}\prod \QQ_p</m>,
              where we only allow tuples <m>(\alpha_p)</m> for which
              <m>\alpha_p \in \ZZ_p</m> for almost all <m>p</m>. See <xref ref="def-restricted-product"/>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        This is a locally compact topological ring, with the groups <m>\frac{1}{n} \widehat{\ZZ}</m> forming a fundamental system of neighborhoods of 0
        consisting of compact subgroups. The natural group homomorphism
        <me>
          \QQ/\ZZ \to \AA^{\fin}_{\QQ}/\widehat{\ZZ}
        </me>
        is an isomorphism.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <p>
      In preparation for the definition of ad&#xe8;les associated to a general number field, we introduce the formalism of restricted products.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-restricted-product">
      <p>
        Let <m>I</m> be an index set. For each <m>i \in I</m>, let <m>G_i</m> be a set and let <m>H_i</m> be a set of <m>G_i</m>.
        The <term>restricted (direct) product</term>
        <m>G</m> of the pairs <m>(G_i, H_i)</m> is the set of tuples <m>(g_i)_{i=1}^\infty</m> such that
        <m>g_i \in H_i</m> for all but finitely many indices <m>i</m>.
        Another way to say this is to define, for each finite subset <m>S \subseteq I</m>, the set
        <me>
          G_S = \prod_{i \in S} G_i \times \prod_{i \notin S} H_i
        </me>
        and take <m>G = \bigcup_S G_S</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
      We upgrade this construction from sets to richer categories as follows.
      <ul>
        <li>
          If each <m>G_i</m> is a group and each <m>H_i</m> is a subgroup, then <m>G</m> admits a group structure.
        </li>
        <li>
          If each <m>G_i</m> is a ring and each <m>H_i</m> is a subring, then <m>G</m> admits a ring structure.
          (However, if each <m>G_i</m> is a field, then <m>G</m> cannot be a field unless <m>I</m> is a singleton set.)
        </li>
        <li>
          If each <m>G_i</m> is a locally compact topological space and each <m>H_i</m> is a compact subspace, then
          <m>G</m> may be viewed as a locally compact topological space. One way to see this is to use a system of neighborhoods of the identity 
          given by taking products of compact neighborhoods <m>S_i \subseteq G_i</m> in which <m>S_i = H_i</m> for all but finitely many <m>i</m>. 
          (Remember that by Tikhonov's theorem, any product of compact topological spaces is compact.)
          Another way is to equip each subset <m>G_S</m> with the product topology, then declare a subset <m>U \subset G</m> to be open if its intersection 
          with each <m>G_S</m> is an open subset of <m>G_S</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Likewise, if each <m>G_i</m> is a locally compact topological group/ring and each <m>H_i</m> is a compact subgroup/subring, then
          <m>G</m> may be viewed as a locally compact topological group/ring.
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Define the <term>ring of ad&#xe8;les</term>
        over <m>\QQ</m> as <m>\AA_{\QQ} = \RR \times \AA^{\fin}_{\QQ}</m>.
        Then <m>\AA_{\QQ}</m> is a locally compact topological ring with a canonical embedding <m>\QQ \hookrightarrow \AA_{\QQ}</m>.
        We refer to the elements of <m>\QQ</m> as <term>principal ad&#xe8;les</term> within <m>\AA_{\QQ}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also view <m>\AA_\QQ</m> as a restricted direct product of the pairs
        <me>
          (\RR, \{0\}), (\QQ_2, \ZZ_2), (\QQ_3, \ZZ_3), \dots
        </me>;
        note that taking the subgroup <m>\{0\}</m> of <m>\RR</m> has no real effect because the definition of the restricted product involves checking membership
        in the chosen subgroup for <em>all but finitely many</em> indices.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Note that <m>\AA_\QQ</m> contains the neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>0</m> consisting of tuples <m>(x)_v</m> where
        <m>|x|_\infty &lt; 1</m> and <m>|x|_p \leq 1</m> for all primes <m>p</m>.
        Any element of the intersection <m>U \cap \QQ</m> must be an integer (because of the condition at primes), but cannot be a nonzero integer
        (due to the condition at the real place); hence <m>U \cap \QQ = \{0\}</m>. That is, just as <m>\ZZ</m> sits inside <m>\RR</m> as a discrete subgroup,
        <m>\QQ</m> sits inside <m>\AA_\QQ</m> as a discrete subgroup.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, we can do somewhat better. Just as the quotient group <m>\RR/\ZZ</m> is covered by the compact subset <m>[0,1]</m> of <m>\RR</m> (and therefore is compact:
        a continous map from a compact topological space to Hausdorff topological space has compact image),
        the quotient group <m>\AA_\QQ/\QQ</m> is covered by a compact subset
        <me>
          [0,1] \times \prod_p \ZZ_p
        </me>
        (see <xref ref="exer-cover-adeles"/>).
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
        In general, the restricted direct product of pairs <m>(G_i, H_i)</m> does not carry the subspace topology from the ordinary product <m>\prod_i G_i</m>.
        We may see a concrete example using <m>\AA^{\fin}_\QQ</m>: for each prime <m>p</m>, let <m>e_p</m> be the element consisting of <m>\frac{1}{p}</m> in the place <m>v=p</m>
        and 0 elsewhere. Then the sequence <m>\{e_p\}</m> converges to zero in <m>\prod_i G_i</m> but <em>not</em> in the restricted product: no cofinite subset of the sequence
        belongs to any neighborhood of 0.

    <title>The ad&#xe8;les (general case)</title>
    <p>
      We now put the Minkowski construction together with profinite completion to define the ring of ad&#xe8;les of a number field.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-adeles-K">
    <p>
      Let <m>K</m> be a number field. By <xref ref="lem-number-ring-completion"/>, the profinite completion <m>\widehat{\gotho_K}</m> is canonically isomorphic to 
      <m>\prod_{\gothp} \gotho_{K_{\gothp}}</m>. We may thus define the <term>ring of finite ad&#xe8;les</term>
      <m>\AA^{\fin}_{K}</m> as any of the following isomorphic objects:
      <ul>
        <li>

            the tensor product <m>\widehat{\gotho_K} \otimes_{\gotho_K} K</m>;

      is an isomorphism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ring of ad&#xe8;les <m>\AA_K</m> is the product <m>K_\RR \times \AA^{\fin}_K</m>. In other words, this is the restricted product
      of the pairs <m>(K_v, \{0\})</m> for infinite places <m>v</m> and <m>(K_v, \gotho_{K_v})</m> for finite places <m>v</m>.
      We again have a diagonal embedding <m>K \hookrightarrow \AA_K</m>; we again refer to the elements of the image of this embedding as

      <proof>
        <p>
          The normalizations have been chosen so that for each place <m>v</m> of <m>\QQ</m>, for each <m>\alpha \in K</m>, the product of

          As a sanity check, we note that for <m>\alpha \in \QQ</m>, we have <m>|\alpha|_w = |\alpha|_v^{[L_w:K_v]}</m> and so the product over <m>w</m> yields
          <me>

          Taking the product over <m>v</m>,
          we deduce that <m>|\alpha|_K = |\Norm_{L/K}(\alpha)|_{\QQ}</m>. That is, the product formula reduces to the case <m>K = \QQ</m>, which we may check directly:
          for <m>\alpha = \pm p_1^{e_1} \cdots p_r^{e_r}</m>,

            |\alpha|_v = \begin{cases} p_1^{e_1} \cdots p_r^{e_r} &amp; \text{if } v = \infty \\

    <p>
      For any finite set <m>S</m> of places, let <m>\AA_{K,S}</m> (resp. <m>\AA^{\fin}_{K,S}</m>) be the subring of <m>\AA_K</m> (resp. <m>\AA^{\fin}_K</m>) 
      consisting of those ad&#xe8;les which are integral at all finite places not contained in <m>S</m>.

      We can formulate an adelic analogue of the Chinese remainder theorem.

    <proposition xml:id="P_adelic_CRT">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any finite set <m>S</m> of places, <m>K + \AA_{K,S}^{\fin} = \AA_K^{\fin}</m> and <m>K + \AA_{K,S} = \AA_K</m>.

      We end up with an adelic analogue of the Minkowski embedding, but with the role of <m>\gotho_K</m> played by the entire field <m>K</m>!
    </p>
    <corollary>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The quotient group <m>\AA_K/K</m> is compact.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </corollary>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Choose a compact subset <m>T</m> of the Minkowski space <m>M</m> containing a fundamental domain for the lattice <m>\gotho_K</m>.
        Then every element of <m>M \times \AA^{\fin}_K</m> is congruent modulo <m>\gotho_K</m> to an element of <m>T \times \AA^{\fin}_K</m>.
        However, we can also interpret <m>M \times \AA^{\fin}_K</m> as <m>\AA_{K,S}</m> where <m>S</m> is the set of infinite places of <m>K</m>.
        We may thus apply <xref ref="P_adelic_CRT"/> to see that
        <md>
          <mrow>
            M/\gotho_K \times \AA^{\fin}_K &amp;\cong (M \times \AA^{\fin}_K)/\gotho_K
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            &amp; \cong \AA_{K,S}/\gotho_K = \AA_{K,S}/(K \cap \AA_{K,S})
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            &amp; = (K + \AA^{K,S})/K \to \AA_K/K
          </mrow>
        </md>
        is surjective.
        Consequently, 
        the compact set <m>T \times \AA^{\fin}_K</m> surjects onto <m>\AA_K/K</m>; the latter is Hausdorff by <xref ref="cor-adeles-discrete"/>,
        so it being covered by a compact set makes it also compact.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <remark>
      <p>
        We mention in passing that just as the various completions of <m>\QQ</m> are <q>rigid</q> in the sense that they have no nontrivial automorphisms even if you ignore the topology
        (<xref ref="exer-no-local-automorphisms-K"/>), the ring <m>\AA_\QQ</m> also has  no nontrivial automorphisms even if you ignore the topology (<xref ref="exer-automorphisms-AQ"/>).
