      With the reciprocity isomorphism in hand, we now prove the existence theorem in its idelic formulation (see <xref ref="T_adelic_existence_theorem1"/>).
      As a reminder, deducing the ideal-theoretic existence theorem (<xref ref="T-existence-theorem"/>) will also require local-global compatibility 
      (<xref ref="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal2"/>), as described in <xref ref="rem-classical-existence-theorem"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in the proof of the local existence theorem (<xref ref="T_local_existence2"/>), having access to the reciprocity law, even in abstract form,
      reduces the task of proving the existence theorem to the <q>topological</q> assertion that every open subgroup of <m>C_L</m> of finite index contains a norm subgroup.
      For this, we can essentially rerun the Kummer-theoretic argument from the local case.
      Since this argument is agnostic as to <em>where</em> the reciprocity map came from, it also applies in the approach that does not use abstract class field theory
      (<xref ref="sec_brauer"/>).
    </p>
    <p>
      After proving the existence theorem, we give the closely related algebraic proof of the Second Inequality (<xref ref="T_first_and_second_inequality"/>).

    <title>A base case for the existence theorem</title>
    <p>
      As in the proof of the local existence theorem (<xref ref="T_local_existence2"/>),
      the key to the proof of <xref ref="T_adelic_existence_theorem2"/> is showing that for any given number field <m>K</m>,
      we can find finite extensions <m>L/K</m> for which the groups <m>\Norm_{L/K} C_L</m> can be made arbitrarily small.
      In preparation for an inductive proof, we establish a key base case using Kummer theory.

          Let <m>K</m> be a number field containing a primitive <m>p</m>-th root of unity for some prime <m>p</m>.
          Let <m>U</m> be an open subgroup of <m>C_K</m> of index <m>p</m>. Then for some finite set <m>S</m> of places of <m>K</m> containing the infinite places
          and all places above <m>p</m>,
          <m>I_K = K^* I_{K,S}</m> and the preimage of <m>U</m> in <m>I_{K,S}</m> contains
          <me>
            W_S := \prod_{v \in S} (K_v^*)^p \times \prod_{v \notin S} \gotho_{K_v}^*
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>J</m> be the preimage of <m>U</m> under the projection <m>I_K \to C_K</m>,
          so that <m>J</m> is open in <m>I_K</m> of index <m>p</m>.
          Then <m>J</m> contains a subgroup of the form
          <me>
            V := \prod_{v \in S} \{1\} \times \prod_{v \notin S} \gotho_{K_v}^*
          </me>
          for some finite set <m>S</m> of places of <m>K</m> containing the infinite places,
          which by <xref ref="lem-generate-ideles-with-S-units"/> we may choose large enough so that <m>I_K = K^* I_{K,S}</m>.
          The group <m>J</m> must also contain <m>I_K^p</m>, and hence <m>W_S</m>.

      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <p>
      We continue with a lemma that allows to detect whether certain elements of a number field are <m>p</m>-th powers based on whether this happens locally.
      This amounts to a carefully chosen special case of the Grunwald-Wang theorem (<xref ref="rmk-Grunwald-Wang"/>).

      <statement>
        <p>
          With notation as in <xref ref="lem-adelic-exponent-p-subgroup"/>,

      <proof>
        <p>
          It is clear that <me>(\gotho_{K,S}^*)^p \subseteq W_S \cap K^*</me>. To prove the reverse inclusion, note that
          for any <m>y \in W_S \cap K^*</m>, if we set <m>L = K(y^{1/p})</m>, then every place <m>v \in S</m> is split in <m>L</m> and 
          every place <m>v \notin S</m> is unramified in <m>L</m>, yielding
          <me>
            \Norm_{L/K} I_{L,S} = I_{K,S}
          </me>.
          Since <m>I_K = K^* I_{K,S}</m>, this implies <m>\Norm_{L/K} C_L = C_K</m>.
          By the First Inequality (<xref ref="T_first_inequality"/>), this implies <m>L = K</m> and so <m>y \in (K^*)^p</m>.

      This will in turn enable us to compute the norm group for a certain compositum of Kummer extensions.

        <p>
          By <xref ref="cor-S-units-theorem"/> and the assumption that <m>K</m> contains a primitive <m>p</m>-th root of unity,
          the group <m>\gotho_{K,S}^*/(\gotho_{K,S}^*)^p</m> is finite of order <m>p^s</m>, yielding <m>[L:K] = p^s</m>.
          By local reciprocity (<xref ref="L_hilbert_symbol"/>), we have <m>K^* W_S/K^* \subseteq \Norm_{L/K} C_L</m>; to prove equality,
          it will suffice to show that these subgroups have the same finite index in <m>C_K</m>.

        <p>
          Consider now the exact sequence

          By <xref ref="L_local-pth-powers-index"/>, the product formula (<xref ref="prop-product-formula"/>),
          and the assumption that <m>S</m> contains all infinite places and all places above <m>p</m>,

          This implies that

        <p>
          We separate cases as follows.
          <ol>
            <li>
                If <m>v</m> is a real place, then <m>p=2</m>, <m>\frac{p^2}{|p|_v} = 2</m>, and

            </li>
            <li>
                If <m>v</m> is a complex place, then <m>\frac{p^2}{|p|_v} = 1</m> according to our conventions (<xref ref="def-normalized-adele-norm"/>), and 
                <m>K_v^*/(K_v^*)^p</m> is trivial because <m>\CC^*</m> is <m>p</m>-divisible.

            <li>
                If <m>v</m> is a finite place not lying above <m>p</m>, then <m>\frac{p^2}{|p|_v} = p^2</m> and

            </li>
            <li>
                If <m>v</m> is a finite place above <m>p</m>, then <m>|p|_v = p^{-n}</m> for <m>n = [K_v:\QQ_p]</m>, so <m>\frac{p^2}{|p|_v} = p^{n+2}</m>.
                Since <m>K_v^* \cong \gotho_{K_v}^* \times \ZZ</m>, it suffices to check that <m>[\gotho_{K_v}^*: (\gotho_{K_v}^*)^p] = p^{n+1}</m>.

          For any finite abelian extension <m>L/K</m>, <m>\Norm_{L/K} C_L</m> is a subgroup of <m>C_K</m> which is open (by <xref ref="L_adelic_norm_is_open"/>)

      Drawing inspiration from the calculation of norm groups given in <xref ref="lem-Kummer-norm-subgroup"/>,

      Again, the key case is where <m>L/K</m> is a cyclic extension of number fields of prime degree <m>p</m> and <m>\zeta_p \in K</m>.
      To modify the calculation from <xref ref="lem-Kummer-norm-subgroup"/> to compute the norm group of a single Kummer extension, we use a second set of places.

          By <xref ref="cor-S-units-theorem"/>, <m>\gotho_{K,S}^*/(\gotho_{K,S}^*)^p \cong (\ZZ/p\ZZ)^s</m>.
          Choose generators <m>g_1, \dots, g_{s-1}</m> of <m>\Gal(N/L)</m>;
          these correspond in <m>\Hom(\gotho_{K,S}^*/(\gotho_{K,S}^*)^p, \ZZ/p\ZZ)</m> to a set of homomorphisms whose common kernel is precisely <m>\Delta/(\gotho_{K,S}^*)^p</m>.
          We thus need to find, for each <m>g_i</m>, a place <m>v_i</m> such that the kernel of <m>g_i</m> is the same as the kernel of <m>\gotho_{K,S}^* \to K_{v_i}^*/(K_{v_i}^*)^p</m>;
          we can then take <m>T := \{v_1,\dots,v_{s-1}\}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>N_i</m> be the fixed field of <m>g_i</m>;
          by <xref ref="C_split_completely"/> (which we deduced from the First Inequality)
          or <xref ref="prop-splitting-primes-density"/> (which was part of the analytic proof of the Second Inequality),
          there are infinitely many primes of <m>N_i</m> that do not split in <m>N</m>.
          So we can choose a place <m>w_i</m> of each <m>N_i</m> such that their restrictions <m>v_i</m> to <m>K</m> are distinct,
          not contained in <m>S</m>, and don't divide <m>p</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We claim <m>N_i</m> is the maximal subextension of <m>N/K</m> in which <m>v_i</m> splits completely 
          (i.e., the <term>decomposition field</term> of <m>v_i</m>).
          On one hand, <m>v_i</m> does not split completely in <m>N</m>,
          so the decomposition field is no larger than <m>N_i</m>.
          On the other hand, the decomposition field is the fixed field of the decomposition group,
          which has exponent <m>p</m> and is cyclic (since <m>v_i</m> does not ramify in <m>N</m>).
          Thus it must have index <m>p</m> in <m>N</m>, so must be <m>N_i</m> itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus <m>L = \bigcap N_i</m> is the maximal subextension of <m>N</m> in which all of the <m>v_i</m> split completely.
          We conclude that for <m>x \in \gotho_{K,S}^*</m>,
          <m>x</m> belongs to <m>\Delta</m> iff <m>K_{v_i}(x^{1/p}) = K_{v_i}</m> for all <m>i</m>,
          which occurs iff <m>x \in K_{v_i}^p</m>.
          That is, <m>\Delta</m> is precisely the kernel of the map <m>\gotho_{K,S}^* \to \prod_i K_{v_i}^*/(K_{v_i}^*)^p</m>.
          This proves the claim.

      We have the following modified version of <xref ref="lem-local-pth-power"/>.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-local-pth-power-T">
      <statement>
        <p>
          With notation as in <xref ref="lem-second-inequality-algebraic-setup"/>, put
          <me>
            W_{S,T} := \prod_{v \in S} (K_v^*)^p \times \prod_{v \in T} K_v^* \times \prod_{v \notin S \cup T} \gotho_{K_v}^*
          </me>.
          Then
          <me>
            W_{S,T} \cap K^* = (\gotho_{K,S \cup T}^*)^p
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          It is again clear that <me>(\gotho_{K,S \cup T}^*)^p \subseteq W_{S,T} \cap K^*</me>. To prove the reverse inclusion, it will again suffice
          to prove that <m>y \in W_{S, T} \cap K^*</m>, if we set <m>L = K(y^{1/p})</m>, then <m>\Norm_{L/K} C_L = C_K</m>;
          namely, <xref ref="T_first_inequality"/> will then imply <m>L = K</m> and so <m>y \in (K^*)^p</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>\gotho_{K,S}^* \to \prod_{v \in T} \gotho_{K_v}^*/(\gotho_{K_v}^*)^p</m>
          is surjective, any element of <m>I_{K,S \cup T}</m> can be written as the product of an element of <m>\gotho_{K,S}^*</m> with an element of <m>I_{K,S \cup T}</m> 
          which is a <m>p</m>-th power at each place of <m>T</m>. In particular, by <xref ref="L_hilbert_symbol"/> such an element is a norm from <m>L</m> at each place of <m>T</m>;
          we can now reprise the proof of <xref ref="lem-local-pth-power"/>, skipping over the places in <m>T</m>, to deduce that we have a norm from <m>L</m>.

          <m>K^* W_{S,T}/K^*</m> is contained in <m>\Norm_{L/K} C_L</m> and has index <m>p</m> in <m>C_K</m>.
          Consequently, the Second Inequality holds for <m>L/K</m>.

            1 \to \frac{\gotho_{K,S\cup T}^*}{(\gotho_{K,S \cup T}^*)^p} \to \frac{I_{K,S \cup T}}{W_{S,T}} \to \frac{C_K}{K^* W_{S,T}/K^*} \to 1
          </me>,
          with which we may compute as in <xref ref="lem-Kummer-norm-subgroup"/>: the left group has order <m>p^{\#(S \cup T)} = p^{2s-1}</m> by <xref ref="cor-S-units-theorem"/> 
          while the middle group has order <m>p^{2s}</m> by <xref ref="L_local-pth-powers-index"/>, so
          <me>
            [C_K: K^* W_{S,T}/K^*] = p
          </me>.
          Meanwhile, we can check by local reciprocity that <m>\Norm_{L/K} I_{L,S} = I_{K,S}</m> (compare the proof of <xref ref="lem-local-pth-power-T"/>).
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                For <m>v \in S</m>, elements of <m>(K_v^*)^p</m> are norms from any abelian extension of <m>K_v</m> of exponent <m>p</m> (by <xref ref="L_hilbert_symbol"/>).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                For <m>v \in T</m>, <m>v</m> splits in <m>L</m> and so <m>L_w = K_v</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                For <m>v \notin S \cup T</m>, <m>v</m> is unramified in <m>L</m> and so <m>\Norm_{L_w/K_v} \gotho_{L_w}^* = \gotho_{K_v}^*</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          Hence <m>K^* W_{S,T} \subseteq \Norm_{L/K} C_L</m>, completing the proof.

        <p>
          For <m>x \in C_K</m>, <m>\Norm_{L/K} (x) = x^p</m>; this implies that both groups in question are killed by <m>p</m>.
          In particular, multiplication by <m>d := [K':K]</m>,

        <p>
          Suppose <m>x \in C_K</m> maps to the identity in <m>H^0_T(\Gal(L'/K'), C_{L'})</m>.
