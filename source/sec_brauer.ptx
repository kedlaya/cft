      We discuss Brauer groups of fields, especially number fields. On one hand these can be used to give an alternate construction of the global reciprocity map,
      not based on abstract class field theory; on the other hand, they carry important information from class field theory which is useful in numerous
      applications.

      In this lecture, we reprise a bit of shorthand from <xref ref="sec_localcomp"/>, writing <m>H^i(L/K)</m> to mean <m>H^i(\Gal(L/K), L^*)</m>.

    <title>The Brauer group of a field</title>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Recall from <xref ref="def-Brauer-group"/> that we have defined the <term>Brauer group</term> of a field <m>K</m> as the group 
        <me>
          \Br(K) = H^2(\overline{K}/K) = \varinjlim_{L/K} H^2(L/K)
        </me>
        where <m>L</m> runs over finite Galois extensions of <m>K</m> and the transition maps in the direct limit are inflation maps.
        By <xref ref="L_theorem_90"/> and <xref ref="P_inflation_restriction"/>, these maps are all injective, so the direct limit is actually a union.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <p>
      This definition of Brauer groups is not the original one; we give that next.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-brauer-defs">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any field <m>K</m>, there is a natural bijection between <m>\Br(K)</m> and the isomorphism classes of division algebras which are finite-dimensional <m>K</m>-algebras
          with center <m>K</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          See <xref ref="bib-Milne-CFT"/>, Corollary IV.3.16; <xref ref="bib-Serre-LocalFields"/>, Chapter X, Proposition 9;
          or <xref ref="bib-Jacobson-2"/>, Theorem 8.11.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <example>
      <p>
        For <m>K</m> an algebraically closed field, every division algebra which is finite dimensional over <m>K</m> is trivial. Namely, if <m>D</m> is such an algebra,
        then for each <m>x \in D</m>, multiplication by <m>x</m> defines a <m>K</m>-linear endomorphism of <m>D</m>, which necessarily has at least one eigenvalue <m>y \in K</m>.
        Then <m>x-y</m> is an element of <m>D</m> which cannot be invertible (since multiplication by this element is a <m>K</m>-linear endomorphism of <m>D</m> with 0
        as an eigenvalue), so it must be zero; hence <m>x \in K</m>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        For <m>K</m> a finite field, <m>\Br(K)</m> is trivial. In the classical interpretation, this is Wedderburn's theorem that every finite division algebra
        is commutative. In the cohomological interpretation, it follows from <xref ref="P_finite_norm_surjective"/> via the periodicity of Tate groups
        <xref ref="T_cyclic_group_periodicity"/>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <remark>
      <p>
        While <xref ref="lem-brauer-defs"/> only characterizes the Brauer group as a set, the original construction of Brauer included the group structure.
        Namely, for any two central simple algebras <m>D_1, D_2</m> over <m>K</m>, we have an isomorphism of <m>K</m>-algebras
        <me>
          D_1 \otimes_K D_2 \cong M_n(D)
        </me>
        for some positive integer <m>n</m> and some division algebra <m>D</m> with center <m>K</m>, and <m>D</m> is the product of <m>D_1</m> and <m>D_2</m> in <m>\Br(K)</m>
        (in particular, it is characterized by this construction up to isomorphism).
      </p>
      <p>
        In this construction, the identity element in <m>\Br(K)</m> is <m>K</m> viewed as a division algebra with itself as the center. The inverse element of a division algebra
        <m>D</m> is the <term>opposite algebra</term> in which multiplication is reversed.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-schur-index">
      <p>
        The property of a field <m>K</m> of characteristic 0 having trivial Brauer group is useful in the theory of finite group representations:
        for such a field, any <m>K</m>-valued character of a finite group arises from a representation defined over <m>K</m>. (This follows from <term>Schur's lemma</term>:
        the character in question appears within some irreducible <m>K</m>-linear representation, whose endomorphism ring is a division algebra;
        the triviality of the Brauer group forces this to split without any base extension.)
      </p>
      <p>
        By contrast,
        for <m>G = \{\pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k\}</m> the unit quaternion group, the standard 2-dimensional representation of <m>G</m> 
        has a <m>\QQ</m>-valued character but cannot be realized
        as a representation over <m>\QQ</m>. In other words, this representation has nontrivial <term>Schur index</term>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
        One can also associate Brauer groups to arbitrary rings and even to schemes in algebraic geometry, by replacing division algebras (or more precisely,
        central simple algebras) with <term>Azumaya algebras</term> and Galois cohomology with <term>&#xe9;tale cohomology</term>.

    <title>The Brauer group of a number field</title>

      We state the formula for the Brauer group of a number field, and prove it modulo one key step.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-H2-map-global-cyclic">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L/K</m> be a cyclic extension of number fields of degree <m>n</m>.
          Then there is a commutative diagram as in <xref ref="fig-connection-5"/>
          in which the vertical arrows are isomorphisms.

          The left square comes from applying <xref ref="T_cyclic_group_periodicity"/> to the morphism

    <theorem xml:id="def-fundamental-exact-sequence">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any number field <m>K</m>, the group <m>\Br(K)</m> fits into an exact sequence of the form
          <me>
            0 \to \Br(K) \to \Br(\AA_K) = \bigoplus_v \Br(K_v) \to \QQ/\ZZ \to 0

            0 &amp; \text{for } v \text{ complex} \end{cases}
          </me>
          and the map on the right is summation.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The map <m>\Br(K) \to \bigoplus_v \Br(K_v)</m> is the injection from <xref ref="T_Albert-Brauer-Hasse-Noether"/>.
          The value of <m>\Br(K_v)</m> for <m>v</m> finite is given by <xref ref="L_local_invariant_map"/>.
          For <m>v</m> complex, it is evident that <m>\Br(K_v) = 0</m>.
          For <m>v</m> real, by <xref ref="T_cyclic_group_periodicity"/> we have
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \Br(\RR) &amp;= H^2(\Gal(\CC/\RR), \CC^*)
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              &amp;\cong H^0_T(\Gal(\CC/\RR), \CC^*)
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              &amp;\cong \RR^* / \Norm_{\CC/\RR} \CC^* = \RR^*/\RR^+ \cong \frac{1}{2} \ZZ/\ZZ
            </mrow>
          </md>.
          Since the values of <m>\Br(K_v)</m> are the ones given, the surjectivity of the map <m>\bigoplus_v \Br(K_v) \to \QQ/\ZZ</m> is evident.
        </p>
        <p>
          It remains to establish exactness at the middle of the sequence. For any finite Galois extension <m>L/K</m>,
          we have the exact sequence
          <me>
            H^2(\Gal(L/K), L^*) \to H^2(\Gal(L/K), I_L) \to H^2(\Gal(L/K), C_L)
          </me>.
          If <m>L/K</m> is cyclic, then by reciprocity (<xref ref="T_abstract_adelic_reciprocity"/>),
          the top row of the commutative diagram in <xref ref="lem-H2-map-global-cyclic"/> is exact, as then is the bottom row.
          Consequently, we could conclude the proof if we knew that every class in <m>\Br(K)</m> is the image of a class in <m>H^2(\Gal(L/K), L^*)</m>
          for some finite <em>cyclic</em> extension <m>L</m> of <m>K</m>. In fact, something even stronger is true; see 
          <xref ref="prop-H2-class-absorb-by-cyclotomic"/>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <definition>
      <p>
        For <m>K</m> a number field and <m>\alpha \in \Br(K)</m>, the image of <m>\alpha</m> in <m>\Br(K_v)</m> is often called the <term>local invariant</term> of <m>\alpha</m> at <m>v</m>.
        The exact sequence appearing in <xref ref="def-fundamental-exact-sequence"/> is sometimes called the <term>fundamental exact sequence</term> associated to <m>K</m>;
        it can be viewed as another source of <q>reciprocity</q> in class field theory. For example, applying the fundamental exact sequence to a quaternion algebra over <m>\QQ</m>
        (see <xref ref="exer-quaternion-algebras"/>) gives rise to Hilbert's reformulation of the law of quadratic reciprocity using <term>Hilbert symbols</term>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fundamental exact sequence also plays a key role in various applications of Brauer groups in number theory. One of these is the detection of obstructions to the existence of rational points
        on algebraic varieties over number fields, called <term>Brauer-Manin obstructions</term>. This construction is based on the following observation: for 
        <m>X</m> an algebraic variety over a number field <m>K</m>, each class in <m>\Br(X)</m> gives rise to a commutative diagram

    <title>All Brauer classes are (cyclic) cyclotomic</title>
    <p>
      Recall that in the cohomological approach to local class field theory, the crucial computation was that of the Brauer groups of local fields,
      which involved first studying unramified extensions and then transferring the knowledge to general extensions (see the proof of <xref ref="P_H2_lower_bound"/>).
      The missing step in <xref ref="def-fundamental-exact-sequence"/> is of a very similar nature, except that we have to vary the extension based on the class.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-H2-class-absorb-by-cyclotomic">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L/K</m> be a Galois extension of number fields.
          Then for any element <m>x</m> of <m>H^2(L/K)</m>, there exist a cyclic cyclotomic extension <m>M</m> of <m>K</m> and an element <m>y</m> of
          <m>H^2(M/K)</m> such that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> map to the same element of <m>H^2(ML/K)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="T_Albert-Brauer-Hasse-Noether"/>, any class in <m>H^2(L/K)</m> is determined by its
          images in <m>H^2(L_w/K_v)</m> for all places <m>v</m> in <m>K</m> (where <m>w</m> denotes any place of <m>L</m> above <m>v</m>), with only finitely many of these being
          nonzero. Moreover, a class in <m>H^2(L_w/K_v)</m> of some order <m>m</m> is killed by replacing <m>K_v</m> by any extension of degree <m>m</m>
          (by <xref ref="rmk-local-classes-unramified"/> and <xref ref="rmk-local-Brauer-transfer"/>; see also <xref ref="bib-Milne-CFT"/>, Theorem III.2.1).
          It thus suffices to find a cyclic cyclotomic extension for which, for some fixed finite set of finite places 
          <m>S</m> of <m>K</m>, the degrees <m>[L_w:K_v]</m> for all <m>v \in S</m> are conveniently large; for this, see <xref ref="exer-large-cyclotomic-degree"/>.
          (Compare also <xref ref="bib-Milne-CFT"/>, Proposition VII.7.2.)

      </proof>

    <remark>
      <p>
        By <xref ref="prop-H2-class-absorb-by-cyclotomic"/>, the field <m>\QQ^{\ab}</m> has trivial Brauer group. Since in addition every complex character of a finite group
        has values in <m>\QQ^{\ab}</m>, it follows that every irreducible complex representation of a finite group can be realized over <m>\QQ^{\ab}</m>;

    <title>Local-global compatibility via Brauer groups</title>
    <p>
      To conclude, we turn things around and show that <xref ref="prop-H2-class-absorb-by-cyclotomic"/> can be used to recover local-global compatibility
      for the reciprocity map (<xref ref="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal"/>). This makes no use of abstract class field theory, 
      although it does use the same inputs (notably the First and Second Inequality).
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-diagonal-cyclotomic">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>K</m> be a number field and put <m>L = K(\zeta_n)</m>.
          Then <m>r_{L/K}: I_K \to \Gal(L/K)</m> maps all principal id&#xe8;les to the identity.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          For <m>K = \QQ</m>, this follows from the explicit description of the Artin map given in <xref ref="D_cyclotomic_reciprocity"/> 
          (or from <xref ref="L_cyclotomic_explicit_reciprocity"/>).
          In general, we have a commutative diagram
          <figure xml:id="fig-connection-2">

          and we know the bottom row kills principal id&#xe8;les and the right column is injective.
          Thus the top row kills principal id&#xe8;les too.

      </proof>

    <proposition xml:id="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal3">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any cyclic extension <m>L/K</m> of number fields, the map <m>r_{L/K}\colon I_K \to \Gal(L/K)</m> kills principal id&#xe8;les.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          To begin with, <xref ref="prop-diagonal-cyclotomic"/> implies that <m>r_{L/K}</m> kills principal id&#xe8;les whenever <m>L/K</m> is a cyclotomic extension,
          and <xref ref="lem-H2-map-global-cyclic"/> implies that in this case the composite <m>H^2(L/K) \to \QQ/\ZZ</m> along the bottom row of
          <xref ref="fig-connection-5"/> vanishes.
          By <xref ref="prop-H2-class-absorb-by-cyclotomic"/>, the same then holds for any cyclic extension <m>L/K</m>.
          By <xref ref="lem-H2-map-global-cyclic"/> again, the composition along the top row of <xref ref="fig-connection-5"/> vanishes, proving the claim.

    <remark xml:id="rmk-local-global-via-brauer">
      <p>
        Let <m>L/K</m> be a cyclic extension of number fields.
        At this point, <m>r_{L/K}</m> kills both principal id&#xe8;les (by <xref ref="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal"/>)
        and norms (since it does so locally), so it induces a map <m>C_K/\Norm_{L/K} C_L \to \Gal(L/K)</m>.
        By the surjectivity of the Artin map, as deduced from the 
        First Inequality (<xref ref="prop-artin-map-surjects"/>), this map is surjective; by comparing orders using the Second Inequality
        (<xref ref="T_first_and_second_inequality"/>), we see that the map is also an isomorphism.
        This establishes local-global compatibility (<xref ref="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal"/>) for cyclic extensions, from which it directly follows also for abelian extensions.
        Hooray again!

    </remark>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-no-abstract-cft">
      <p>
        Note that for a cyclic extension <m>L/K</m> of number fields, <xref ref="rmk-local-global-via-brauer"/> establishes not just local-global compatbility,
        but the entire reciprocity isomorphism

          C_K/\Norm_{L/K} C_L \cong \Gal(L/K)^{\ab}
        </me>
        without use of abstract class field theory. One can say the same for an abelian extension: in this case, local reciprocity (<xref ref="T_local_reciprocity"/>)
        and <xref ref="rmk-local-global-via-brauer"/> together imply that we have a well-defined map. Using the cyclic case, we may see that this map is surjective;
        by <xref ref="C_second_inequality_analytic"/> (a side effect of our proof of the Second Inequality), the map is forced to be an isomorphism.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is less clear how to recover the norm limitation theorem, which is needed to prove the existence theorem.
        The difficulty is that if <m>L/K</m> is not abelian and <m>M/K</m> is its maximal abelian subextension, then the maximal abelian subextension of a completion of <m>L</m>
        can be strictly larger than the corresponding completion of <m>M</m>; so we cannot simply apply the local norm limitation theorem.
        Instead, one first uses the fundamental exact sequence (<xref ref="def-fundamental-exact-sequence"/>, whose proof depended on reciprocity only for cyclic extensions)
        to argue that <m>C_L</m> satisfies the hypotheses of Tate's theorem
        (<xref ref="T_tate_thm2"/>), which yields an isomorphism
        <me>
          \Gal(L/K)^{\ab} \cong H^{-2}_T(\Gal(L/K), \ZZ) \to H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), C_L) = C_K/\Norm_{L/K} C_L
        </me>.
        By comparing with the construction of the local reciprocity map, we see that the inverse of this isomorphism is exactly <m>r_{L/K}</m>,
        which yields the norm limitation theorem. See <xref ref="bib-Milne-CFT"/>, Theorem VIII.4.8 for more details.

          Let <m>D</m> be a quaternion algebra over a field <m>K</m> (see <xref ref="exer-quaternion-algebras"/>).
          Prove the following statements directly (without using <xref ref="lem-brauer-defs"/>).
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>D</m> is isomorphic to its opposite algebra.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                There is an isomorphism <m>D \otimes_K D \cong M_4(K)</m> of <m>K</m>-algebras. 
                Consequently, if <m>D</m> is not split, then it represents an element of <m>\Br(K)</m> of order 2.
