      We discuss Brauer groups of fields, especially number fields. On one hand these can be used to give an alternate construction of the global reciprocity map,
      not based on abstract class field theory, by taking local-global compatibility as the source of the definition and then checking the reciprocity isomorphism
      using Tate's theorem.
      On the other hand, Brauer groups carry important information from class field theory which is useful in numerous
      applications, such as finding rational points on algebraic varieties (<xref ref="rmk-Brauer-Manin-obstruction"/>).
    </p>
    <p>
      In this lecture, we reprise a bit of shorthand from <xref ref="sec_localcomp"/>, writing <m>H^i(L/K)</m> to mean <m>H^i(\Gal(L/K), L^*)</m>.
      Beware that <xref ref="bib-Milne-CFT"/> uses a different convention here, writing <m>H^i(L/K)</m> to mean <m>H^i(\Gal(L/K), C_L)</m>.

    <title>The Brauer group of a field</title>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Recall from <xref ref="def-Brauer-group"/> that we have defined the <term>Brauer group</term> of a field <m>K</m> as the group 
        <me>
          \Br(K) := H^2(\overline{K}/K) = \varinjlim_{L/K} H^2(L/K)
        </me>
        where <m>L</m> runs over finite Galois extensions of <m>K</m> and the transition maps in the direct limit are inflation maps.
        By <xref ref="L_theorem_90"/> and <xref ref="P_inflation_restriction"/>, these maps are all injective, so the direct limit is actually a union.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <p>
      This definition of Brauer groups is not the original one; we give that next.
      The standard definition is not needed for the results of class field theory, but is important in other contexts
      such as <xref ref="rmk-Brauer-Manin-obstruction"/>.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        An <term>Azumaya algebra</term> of rank <m>n</m> (a positive integer) over a field <m>K</m>
        is a (not necessarily commutative) <m>K</m>-algebra <m>A</m> such that <m>A \otimes_K \overline{K}</m> is isomorphic as a <m>\overline{K}</m>-algebra
        to the matrix algebra <m>M_n(\overline{K})</m>.
        One way this can occur is for <m>A</m> to itself be isomorphic to the matrix algebra <m>M_n(K)</m>; when this occurs we say that <m>A</m> is <term>split</term>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are various equivalent characterizations of Azumaya algebras (<xref ref="bib-Poonen"/>, Proposition 1.5.2).
        For example, <m>A</m> is an Azumaya algebra over <m>K</m> if and only if it is isomorphic to a matrix ring over some division algebra (skew field) <m>D</m>
        which is itself a finite dimensional <m>K</m>-algebra; and the isomorphism class of <m>D</m> is uniquely determined by that of <m>A</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-brauer-defs">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any field <m>K</m>, there is a natural bijection between <m>\Br(K)</m> and the isomorphism classes of division algebras which are finite-dimensional <m>K</m>-algebras
          with center <m>K</m>.
          Moreover, the group structure on <m>\Br(K)</m> corresponds as follows:
          <ol>
            <li>
              The identity element of <m>\Br(K)</m> corresponds to <m>K</m>.
            </li>
            <li>
              The group operation in <m>\Br(K)</m> corresponds to the operation carrying a pair <m>D_1, D_2</m> of division algebras to the unique division algebra <m>D</m> such that
              <m>D_1 \otimes D_2 \cong M_n(D)</m> for some positive integer <m>n</m>.
            </li>
            <li>
              The inverse map on <m>\Br(K)</m> corresponds to the operation taking <m>D</m> to its <term>opposite algebra</term>, i.e., the same underlying additive group
              with multiplication taken in the reverse order.
            </li>
          </ol>

    <example xml:id="exa-brauer-alg-closed">
      <p>
        For <m>K</m> an algebraically closed field, <xref ref="lem-brauer-defs"/> includes the assertion that every division algebra which is finite dimensional over <m>K</m> is trivial.
        We may check this directly as follows.
        If <m>D</m> is such a division algebra,
        then for each <m>x \in D</m>, multiplication by <m>x</m> defines a <m>K</m>-linear endomorphism of <m>D</m>, which necessarily has at least one eigenvalue <m>y \in K</m>.
        Then <m>x-y</m> is an element of <m>D</m> which cannot be invertible (since multiplication by this element is a <m>K</m>-linear endomorphism of <m>D</m> with <m>0</m>
        as an eigenvalue), so it must be zero; hence <m>x \in K</m>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        For <m>K</m> a finite field, <m>\Br(K)</m> is trivial. In the classical interpretation, this is Wedderburn's theorem that every finite division algebra
        is commutative. In the cohomological interpretation, it follows from <xref ref="P_finite_norm_surjective"/> via the periodicity of Tate groups
        (<xref ref="T_cyclic_group_periodicity"/>).

    <remark xml:id="rmk-schur-index">
      <p>
        The property of a field <m>K</m> of characteristic 0 having trivial Brauer group is useful in the theory of finite group representations:
        for such a field, any <m>K</m>-valued character of a finite group arises from a representation defined over <m>K</m>. (This follows from <term>Schur's lemma</term>:
        the character in question appears within some irreducible <m>K</m>-linear representation, whose endomorphism ring is a division algebra;
        the triviality of the Brauer group forces this to split without any base extension.)
      </p>
      <p>
        By contrast,
        for <m>G = \{\pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k\}</m> the unit quaternion group, the standard 2-dimensional representation of <m>G</m> 
        has a <m>\QQ</m>-valued character but cannot be realized
        as a representation over <m>\QQ</m>. In other words, this representation has nontrivial <term>Schur index</term>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-Brauer-group-scheme">
      <p>
        One can also associate Brauer groups to arbitrary rings and even to schemes in algebraic geometry, by extending the definition of Azumaya algebras suitably.
        One again has a relationship with Galois cohomology (or rather <term>&#xe9;tale cohomology</term>), but there is a bit more subtlety involved.
        See <xref ref="bib-Grothendieck-Brauer"/> for a classical reference or <xref ref="bib-Poonen"/>, section 6.6 for a modern treatment.

    <title>The Brauer group of a number field</title>
    <p>
      We state the formula for the Brauer group of a number field, and prove it modulo one key step which we will cover a bit later.
      To accommodate readers who skipped over abstract class field theory,
      we present the argument in such a way as to avoid using global reciprocity.
      We will however use a weaker reciprocity statement for cyclotomic extensions
      whose proof does not require prior knowledge of the general case.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-diagonal-cyclotomic">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>K</m> be a number field and put <m>L = K(\zeta_n)</m>.
          Then <m>r_{L/K}\colon I_K \to \Gal(L/K)</m> is surjective and factors through <m>C_K</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The surjectivity is a direct consequence of Artin reciprocity 
          for a cyclotomic extension (<xref ref="D_cyclotomic_reciprocity"/>).
          Alternatively, it can be deduced from the First Inequality (<xref ref="prop-artin-map-surjects"/>).
        </p>
        <p>
          For <m>K = \QQ</m>, the fact that <m>r_{L/K}</m> factors through <m>C_K</m>
          follows from the explicit description of the local reciprocity maps given in <xref ref="rmk-cyclotomic-Artin"/>.
          In general, from <xref ref="prop-norm-compatibility-of-local-reciprocity"/> we have a commutative diagram
          <figure xml:id="fig-connection-2">
            <image width="50%">

                  I_L \ar[r] \ar^{\Norm_{L_w/\QQ_p}}[d] &amp; \Gal(L_w(\zeta_n)/L_w) \ar[d]\\
                  I_{\QQ} \ar[r] &amp; \Gal(\QQ_p(\zeta_n)/\QQ_p)

          and we know the bottom row kills principal id&#xe8;les and the right column is injective.
          Thus the top row kills principal id&#xe8;les too.

          The left square comes from applying <xref ref="T_cyclic_group_periodicity"/> to the morphism
          <m>L^* \to I_L</m> of <m>\Gal(L/K)</m>-modules. Since <m>r_{L/K}</m> is defined in terms of local reciprocity maps,
          the right square comes from <xref ref="L_local_invariant_map"/>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To deduce that both rows of the diagram are exact, it now suffices to check for the top row.
          We get an exact sequence
          <me>
            0 \to H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), L^*) \to H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), I_L) \to  H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), C_L) \to 0
          </me>
          by noting that <m>H^{-1}_T(\Gal(L/K), C_L) = 0</m>
          by <xref ref="T_first_and_second_inequality"/>
          and <m>H^1_T(\Gal(L/K), L^*) = 0</m> by <xref ref="L_theorem_90"/>. 
          Since <m>L/K</m> is cyclic,
          we may also apply <xref ref="T_first_inequality"/> and <xref ref="T_first_and_second_inequality"/> to see that <m>\# H^0_T(\Gal(L/K),C_L) = n</m>.
          Since <m>L/K</m> is cyclotomic, we may apply <xref ref="prop-diagonal-cyclotomic"/> to obtain a surjective map
          <me>
            C_K/\Norm_{L/K} C_L \to \Gal(L/K)

          between two groups of order <m>n</m>; it is thus an isomorphism and we are done.

    <theorem xml:id="def-fundamental-exact-sequence">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any number field <m>K</m>, the group <m>\Br(K)</m> fits into an exact sequence of the form

          </me>
          and the map on the right is summation.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The map <m>\Br(K) \to \bigoplus_v \Br(K_v)</m> is the injection from <xref ref="T_Albert-Brauer-Hasse-Noether"/>.
          The value of <m>\Br(K_v)</m> for <m>v</m> finite is given by <xref ref="L_local_invariant_map"/>.
          For <m>v</m> complex, it is evident that <m>\Br(K_v) = 0</m>.
          For <m>v</m> real, by <xref ref="T_cyclic_group_periodicity"/> we have
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \Br(\RR) &amp;= H^2(\CC/\RR)
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              &amp;\cong H^0_T(\CC/\RR)
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              &amp;\cong \RR^* / \Norm_{\CC/\RR} \CC^* = \RR^*/\RR^+ \cong \tfrac{1}{2} \ZZ/\ZZ
            </mrow>
          </md>.
          Since the values of <m>\Br(K_v)</m> are the ones given, the surjectivity of the map <m>\bigoplus_v \Br(K_v) \to \QQ/\ZZ</m> is evident.
          It thus remains to establish exactness at the middle of the sequence;
          that is, we must check that a class in <m>\bigoplus_v \Br(K_v)</m> maps to zero in <m>\QQ/\ZZ</m> if and only if it arises from some element of <m>\Br(K)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fix such a class <m>(\alpha_v)_v \in \bigoplus_v \Br(K_v)</m> and let <m>S</m> be the finite set of places <m>v</m> at which <m>\alpha_v \neq 0</m>.
          Let <m>n</m> be the least common multiple of the orders of the <m>\alpha_v</m>.
          Using <xref ref="exer-large-cyclotomic-degree"/>, we can find a cyclic cyclotomic extension <m>L/K</m> such that for each <m>v \in S</m>,
          for some (hence any) place <m>w</m> of <m>L</m> over <m>v</m>, the degree <m>[L_w:K_v]</m> is divisible by <m>n</m>.
          By <xref ref="L_local_invariant_map"/>, this means that <m>\alpha_v \in H^2(L_w/K_v)</m> for all <m>v</m>.
          We can now use <xref ref="lem-H2-map-global-cyclic"/> to argue in one direction: 
          if <m>\alpha</m> maps to zero in <m>\QQ/\ZZ</m>, then it lifts to <m>H^2(L/K) \subset \Br(K)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To argue in the opposite direction, we need a bit more: we need to know that every class of <m>\Br(K)</m>
          belongs to <m>H^2(L/K)</m> for some cyclic cyclotomic extension <m>L</m> of <m>K</m>. 
          For this, see <xref ref="prop-H2-class-absorb-by-cyclotomic"/>.
        </p>
      </proof>

    <definition>
      <p>
        For <m>K</m> a number field and <m>\alpha \in \Br(K)</m>, the image of <m>\alpha</m> in <m>\Br(K_v)</m> is often called the <term>local invariant</term> of <m>\alpha</m> at <m>v</m>.
        The exact sequence appearing in <xref ref="def-fundamental-exact-sequence"/> is sometimes called the <term>fundamental exact sequence</term> associated to <m>K</m>;
        it can be viewed as another source of <q>reciprocity</q> in class field theory. For example, applying the fundamental exact sequence to a quaternion algebra over <m>\QQ</m>
        (see <xref ref="exer-quaternion-algebras"/>) gives rise to Hilbert's reformulation of the law of quadratic reciprocity using <term>Hilbert symbols</term>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fundamental exact sequence also plays a key role in various applications of Brauer groups in number theory.

        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          To begin with, <xref ref="prop-diagonal-cyclotomic"/> implies that <m>r_{L/K}</m> kills principal id&#xe8;les whenever <m>L/K</m> is a cyclotomic extension,
          and <xref ref="lem-H2-map-global-cyclic"/> implies that in this case the composite <m>H^2(L/K) \to \frac{1}{n} \ZZ/\ZZ</m> along the bottom row of
          <xref ref="fig-connection-5"/> vanishes.
          By <xref ref="prop-H2-class-absorb-by-cyclotomic"/>, the same then holds for any cyclic extension <m>L/K</m>.
          By <xref ref="lem-H2-map-global-cyclic"/> again, the composition along the top row of <xref ref="fig-connection-5"/> vanishes, proving the claim.

        Let <m>L/K</m> be a cyclic extension of number fields.
        At this point, <m>r_{L/K}</m> kills both principal id&#xe8;les (by <xref ref="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal"/>)
        and norms (since it does so locally), so it induces a map <m>C_K/\Norm_{L/K} C_L \to \Gal(L/K)</m>.
        By the surjectivity of the Artin map, as deduced from the 
        First Inequality (<xref ref="prop-artin-map-surjects"/>), this map is surjective; by comparing orders using the Second Inequality
        (<xref ref="T_first_and_second_inequality"/>), we see that the map is also an isomorphism.
        This establishes local-global compatibility (<xref ref="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal"/>) for cyclic extensions, 
        from which it directly follows also for abelian extensions.

        Note that for a cyclic extension <m>L/K</m> of number fields, <xref ref="rmk-local-global-via-brauer"/> establishes not just local-global compatbility,

          C_K/\Norm_{L/K} C_L \cong \Gal(L/K)^{\ab}

        without use of abstract class field theory. One can say the same for an abelian extension: in this case, local reciprocity (<xref ref="T_local_reciprocity"/>)
        and <xref ref="rmk-local-global-via-brauer"/> together imply that we have a well-defined map. Using the cyclic case, we may see that this map is surjective;
        by <xref ref="C_second_inequality_analytic"/> (a side effect of our proof of the Second Inequality), the map is forced to be an isomorphism.

        However, this is not enough to recover the norm limitation theorem. For this, we take a slightly different approach; see <xref ref="prop-global-H2-cyclic"/>

    <title><m>H^2</m> and global reciprocity</title>
    <p>
      As noted in <xref ref="rmk-no-abstract-cft"/>, we have a bit more work to do to establish global reciprocity without abstract class field theory:
      so far we only have it for abelian extensions, but we need the stronger version for arbitrary extensions to deduce the norm limitation theorem.
      We get this by calculating <m>H^2(\Gal(L/K), C_L)</m>.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-global-H2-cyclic">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>L/K</m> a Galois extension of number fields, <m>H^2(\Gal(L/K), C_L)</m> is cyclic of order <m>[L:K]</m> with a canonical generator.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          From the Second Inequality (<xref ref="T_first_and_second_inequality"/>) we have that <m>\#H^2(\Gal(L/K), C_L) \leq [L:K]</m>,
          so it suffices to produce a cyclic subgroup of order <m>[L:K]</m> with a canonical generator.
          For this, note that by taking cohomology of the exact sequence
          <me>
            0 \to L^* \to I_L \to C_L \to 0
          </me>
          and using the vanishing of <m>H^1(\Gal(L/K), C_L)</m> (<xref ref="T_first_and_second_inequality"/> again), we obtain an exact sequence
          <me>
            0 \to H^2(\Gal(L/K), L^*) \to H^2(\Gal(L/K), I_L) \to  H^2(\Gal(L/K), C_L)
          </me>.
          Using <xref ref="def-fundamental-exact-sequence"/> we see that the cokernel of <m>H^2(\Gal(L/K), L^*) \to H^2(\Gal(L/K), I_L)</m> admits a canonical
          isomorphism with <m>\frac{1}{[L:K]}\ZZ/\ZZ</m>, proving the claim.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-global-reciprocity-via-cup-product">
      <p>
        At this point, we can construct a new map
        <me>
          \Gal(L/K)^{\ab} \cong H^{-2}_T(\Gal(L/K), \ZZ) \to H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), C_L) \cong C_K/\Norm_{L/K} C_L
        </me>
        by taking the cup product with the canonical generator of <m>H^2(\Gal(L/K), C_L)</m> produced in <xref ref="prop-global-H2-cyclic"/>.
        Since the hypotheses of Tate's theorem (<xref ref="T_tate_thm2"/>) are satisfied (the vanishing of <m>H^1</m> by <xref ref="T_first_and_second_inequality"/>,
        the value of <m>H^2</m> by <xref ref="prop-global-H2-cyclic"/>) this map is an isomorphism.
        By local-to-global compatibility, this is in fact the inverse of the reciprocity map;
        we thus recover the reciprocity isomorphism for arbitrary (not necessarily abelian) extensions
        (<xref ref="T_adelic_reciprocity_law"/>). 
        As usual, this formally implies the norm limitation theorem as in <xref ref="rem-deduce-local-norm-limitation"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, the reader who is avoiding abstract class field theory can now return to <xref ref="sec_existence"/>
        for the proof of the existence theorem: the argument given therein (<xref ref="T_adelic_existence_theorem2"/>)
        depends only on the formulation of global reciprocity, not any particular method of proof.

    <title>An application to rational points on varieties</title>
    <p>
      The computation of the Brauer groups of number fields has many interesting applications, including to the study of rational points on varieties.
      We remark on this point here. 
    </p>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-Brauer-Manin-obstruction">
      <p>
        Let <m>X</m> be an algebraic variety over a number field <m>K</m>.
        For each place <m>v</m> of <m>K</m>, one can ask whether the set of <m>K_v</m>-rational points <m>X(K_v)</m> is empty.
        If this holds for some <m>v</m>, then evidently <m>X(K)</m> is also empty.
        However, the converse is generally not true; that is, there is no <term>local-to-global principle</term> for the existence of rational points
        on a general algebraic variety.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was first observed by Manin that this failure can sometimes be overcome using the Brauer group <m>\Br(X)</m>
        (<xref ref="rmk-Brauer-group-scheme"/>). The key relevant point for now is that 
        the construction of <m>\Br(X)</m> is contravariantly functorial, so any <m>K</m>-rational point <m>x \in X(K)</m> gives rise to a
        homomorphism <m>\Br(X) \to \Br(K)</m>. We can view this construction as a <q>pairing</q> <m>X(K) \times \Br(X) \to \Br(K)</m>, although
        it is only linear in the second argument as there is no natural group structure on <m>X(K)</m> in general.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each place <m>v</m> of <m>K</m>, we can form the base extension <m>X_v := X \times_K K_v</m>, so that <m>X_v(K_v) = X(K_v)</m>.
        In particular, for each <m>x \in X(K)</m>, we get a corresponding point <m>x_v \in K_v</m>.
        Meanwhile, for each class <m>y \in \Br(X)</m>, 
        and define <m>y_v \in \Br(X_v)</m> as the image of <m>y</m> under the functoriality map <m>\Br(X_v) \to \Br(X)</m>.
        We again get a local pairing <m>X(K_v) \times \Br(X_v) \to \Br(K_v)</m>.
        Note that the map <m>X(K_v) \to \Br(K_v)</m> induced by pairing with a given <m>x</m> is locally constant for the <m>v</m>-adic topology on <m>X(K_v)</m>
        (<xref ref="bib-Poonen"/>, Proposition 8.2.9).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let <m>\inv_v\colon \Br(K_v) \to \QQ/\ZZ</m> be the local invariant map at the place <m>v</m>.
        The key point is now to apply <xref ref="def-fundamental-exact-sequence"/>: given a class <m>y \in \Br(X)</m>, a necessary condition
        for a tuple <m>(x_v)_v \in \prod_v X(K_v)</m> to come from a global point <m>x \in X(K)</m> is that the sum of the local invariants
        <m>\inv_v(x_v, y_n)</m> must vanish. That is, each <m>y</m> gives rise to a commutative diagram as in
        <xref ref="fig-connection-7"/> 
        in which the vertical maps are evaluation maps and the bottom row is the fundamental exact sequence.
      </p>
      <figure xml:id="fig-connection-7">
        <image>
          <latex-image>
            \xymatrix{
              &amp; X(K) \ar[r] \ar[d] &amp; X(\AA_K) \ar[d] \\
              0 \ar[r] &amp; \Br(K) \ar[r] &amp; \Br(\AA_K) \ar[r] &amp; \QQ/\ZZ \ar[r] &amp; 0
            }
          </latex-image>
        </image>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Applying this condition for all <m>y \in \Br(X)</m> picks out a subset of <m>\prod_v X(K_v)</m>,
        the <term>Brauer set</term>, which must contain all of <m>X(K)</m>; when this happens,
        <m>X</m> is said to have a <term>Brauer-Manin obstruction</term> forcing <m>X(K) = \emptyset</m>.
        More commonly, one says that <m>X</m> admits a <term>Brauer-Manin obstruction to the local-global principle</term>
        if each <m>X(K_v)</m> to be nonempty but the Brauer set is empty.
        See <xref ref="bib-Poonen"/>, Chapter 8 for some examples where this occurs.
