  <title>The adelic formulation</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The <m>p</m>-adic numbers, and more general local fields,
      were introduced into number theory as a way to translate local facts about number fields (i.e., facts concerning a single prime ideal) into statements of a topological flavor.
      To prove the statements of class field theory,
      we need an analogous global construction.
      To this end,
      we construct a topological object that includes all of the completions of a number field,
      including both the archimedean and nonarchimedean ones.
      This object will be the ring of <term>ad&#xe8;les</term>, and it will lead us to the right target group for a statement of global reciprocity
      more parallel to the local theory.

      <title>Spelling note</title>
      <p>
        There is a lack of consensus regarding the presence or absence of accents in the words
        <em>ad&#xe8;le</em> and <em>id&#xe8;le</em>.
        The term <em>id&#xe8;le</em> is thought to be a contraction of
        <q>ideal element</q>; it makes its first appearance,
        with the accent, in Chevalley's 1940 paper <xref ref="bib-Chevalley" />.
        The term <em>ad&#xe8;le</em> appeared in the 1950s, possibly as a contraction of
        <q>additive id&#xe8;le</q>; it appears to have been suggested by Weil as a replacement for Tate's term
        <q>valuation vector</q>
        and Chevalley's term
        <q>repartition</q>. Based on this history, we have opted for the accented spellings here;
        however, we drop the accent in inflected forms such as <q>adelic</q>.
