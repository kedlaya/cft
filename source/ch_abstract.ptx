  <title>Abstract class field theory</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We now turn to an alternate method for deriving the results of local class field theory,
      particularly the local reciprocity law (<xref ref="T_local_reciprocity"/>).
      This method, based on a presentation of Artin and Tate (the method of <q>class formations</q> introduced in <xref ref="bib-Artin-Tate"/>),
      isolates the main cohomological inputs in the local case
      and gives an outline of how to proceed to global class field theory. We conclude with a preview of how the method will apply in the global case;
      see <xref ref="sec_look_ahead"/>.

      This chapter can be skipped on first reading, as <xref ref="ch_adelic"/> is logically independent of it.
      In fact the reader who wishes to avoid class formations entirely can do so with some care;
      see the introduction to <xref ref="ch_main_results"/> for instructions.

      <title>Caveat</title>
      <p>
        In the context of abstract class field theory, we will assign certain words (e.g., <term>unramified</term>) new meanings that will coincide with their
        existing definitions when the abstract setup is specialized to local class field theory. We will then transfer these meanings to the global application
        of abstract class field theory, where we will use scare quotes (i.e., <q>unramified</q>) to indicate the transferred usage
        when it conflicts with a standard meaning.
