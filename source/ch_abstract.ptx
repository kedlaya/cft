  <title>Abstract class field theory</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We now turn to an alternate method for deriving the results of local class field theory,
      particularly the local reciprocity law (<xref ref="T_local_reciprocity"/>).
      This method, based on a presentation of Artin and Tate (the method of <q>class formations</q> introduced in <xref ref="bib-Artin-Tate"/>),
      isolates the main cohomological inputs in the local case
      and gives an outline of how to proceed to global class field theory. We conclude with a preview of how the method will apply in the global case;
      see <xref ref="sec_look_ahead"/>.

      <title>Caveat</title>
      <p>
        In the context of abstract class field theory, we will assign certain words (e.g., <term>unramified</term>) new meanings that will coincide with their
        existing definitions when the abstract setup is specialized to local class field theory. We will then transfer these meanings to the global application
        of abstract class field theory, where we will usually use scare quotes (i.e., <q>unramified</q>).
