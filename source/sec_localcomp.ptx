        If you catch me writing <m>H^i(L/K)</m> for <m>L/K</m> a Galois extension of fields,
        that's shorthand for <m>H^i(\Gal(L/K), L^*)</m>.
        Likewise for <m>H_i</m> or <m>H^i_T</m>.

    <title>Overview</title>
    <p>
      We now make some computations of <m>H^i_T(L/K)</m> for <m>L/K</m> a Galois extension of local fields.
      To begin with, recall that by <q>Theorem 90</q> (<xref ref="L_theorem_90"/>), <m>H^1(L/K) = 0</m>.
      Our next goal will be to supplement this fact with a computation of <m>H^2(L/K)</m>.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="P_local_h2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any finite Galois extension <m>L/K</m> of local fields,
          <m>H^2(L/K)</m> is cyclic of order <m>[L:K]</m>.
          Moreover, this group can be canonically identified with
          <m>\frac{1}{[L:K]}\ZZ/\ZZ</m> in such a way that if <m>M/L</m> is another finite extension such that <m>M/K</m> is also Galois,
          the inflation homomorphism
          <m>H^2(L/K) \to H^2(M/K)</m> corresponds to the inclusion <m>\frac{1}{[L:K]}\ZZ/\ZZ \subseteq \frac{1}{[M:K]}\ZZ/\ZZ</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          For the first assertion, see <xref ref="P_H2_upper_bound"/> and <xref ref="P_H2_lower_bound"/>.
          For the second assertion, see <xref ref="L_local_invariant_map"/>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Before continuing,
        it is worth keeping in a safe place the exact sequence
        <me>
          1 \to \gotho_L^* \to L^* \to L^*/\gotho_L^* = \pi_L^\ZZ \to 1
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this exact sequence of <m>G = \Gal(L/K)</m>-modules,
        the action on <m>\pi_L^\ZZ</m> is always trivial
        (since the valuation on <m>L</m> is Galois-invariant).
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-local-galois-solvable">
      <p>
        Another basic fact to keep in mind is that any finite Galois extension of local fields is <em>solvable</em>.
        To wit, the maximal unramified extension is cyclic,; the maximal tamely ramified extension is cyclic over that;
        and the rest is a Galois extension whose degree is a power of <m>p</m>, and every finite <m>p</m>-group is solvable.
      </p>
      <p>
        This will allow us to simplify some of the following arguments by writing a general Galois extension as a tower of successive
        cyclic extensions. Of course we will have no such shortcut in the global case, because the Galois group of a Galois extension of number
        fields can be any group whatsoever; in fact the inverse Galois problem asks whether this always occurs for an extension over <m>\QQ</m>,
        and no counterexample is known.

    <title>The unramified case</title>
    <p>
      Recall that unramified extensions are cyclic,
      since their Galois groups are also the Galois groups of extensions of finite fields.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="P_finite_norm_surjective">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any finite extension <m>L/K</m> of <em>finite</em> fields,
          the map <m>\Norm_{L/K}\colon L^* \to K^*</m> is surjective.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          One can certainly give an elementary proof of this using the fact that <m>L^*</m> is cyclic
          (see <xref ref="exer-norm-map-finite"/>).
          But one can also see it using the machinery we have at hand.
          Because <m>L^*</m> is a finite module, its Herbrand quotient is 1.
          Also, we know <m>H^1_T(L/K)</m> is trivial by <xref ref="L_theorem_90"/>.
          Thus <m>H^0_T(L/K)</m> is trivial too, that is, <m>\Norm_{L/K}\colon L^* \to K^*</m> is surjective.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <proposition xml:id="P_unramified_norm_surjective">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any finite unramified extension <m>L/K</m> of local fields, the map <m>\Norm_{L/K}\colon \gotho_L^* \to \gotho_K^*</m> is surjective.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Say <m>u \in \gotho_K^*</m> is a unit.
          By <xref ref="P_finite_norm_surjective"/>, we may pick <m>v_0 \in \gotho_L^*</m> such that in the residue fields,
          the norm of <m>v_0</m> coincides with <m>u</m>.
          Thus <m>u/\Norm(v_0) \equiv 1 \pmod{\pi}</m>, where <m>\pi</m> is a uniformizer of <m>K</m>.
          Now we construct units <m>v_i \equiv 1 \pmod{\pi^i}</m> such that <m>u_i = u/\Norm(v_0\cdots v_i) \equiv 1 \pmod{\pi^{i+1}}</m>:
          simply take <m>v_i</m> so that <m>\Trace((1-v_i)/\pi^i) \equiv (1-u_{i-1})/\pi^i \pmod{\pi}</m>.
          (That's possible because the trace map on residue fields is surjective by the normal basis theorem.)
          Then the product <m>v_0v_1\cdots</m> converges to a unit <m>v</m> with norm <m>u</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <corollary xml:id="C_cohomology_of_units_unramified">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any finite unramified extensions <m>L/K</m> of local fields, <m>H^i_T(\Gal(L/K), \gotho_L^*) = 1</m> for all <m>i \in \ZZ</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Again, <m>\Gal(L/K)</m> is cyclic, so by <xref ref="T_cyclic_group_periodicity"/> we need only check this for <m>i=0,1</m>.
          For <m>i=0</m>, it is <xref ref="P_unramified_norm_surjective"/>.
          For <m>i=1</m>, note that because <m>L/K</m> is unramified, we can split the surjection <m>L^* \to L^*/\gotho_L^*</m>
          by choosing a uniformizer <m>\pi_K</m> of <m>K</m> and writing <m>L^* = \gotho_L^* \pi_K^\ZZ</m>. Hence
          <m>H^1_T(\Gal(L/K), \gotho_L^*)</m> is a direct summand of <m>H^1_T(\Gal(L/K), L^*)</m>, and the latter vanishes by <xref ref="L_theorem_90"/>. 
        </p>
      </proof>
    </corollary>
    <proposition xml:id="P_H2_unramified">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any finite unramified extension <m>L/K</m> of local fields,
          <m>H^2(L/K)</m> is cyclic of order <m>[L:K]</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          As in the proof of <xref ref="C_cohomology_of_units_unramified"/>, we use the fact that <m>L^*</m> splits as <m>\gotho_L^* \pi_K^\ZZ</m>
          to argue that
          <me>
            H^2(L/K) \cong H^2(\Gal(L/K), \gotho_L^*) \oplus H^2(\Gal(L/K), \ZZ)
          </me>;
          the first summand is zero by <xref ref="C_cohomology_of_units_unramified"/>, while by periodicity (<xref ref="T_cyclic_group_periodicity"/>) the second summand is
          <m>H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), \ZZ) \cong \ZZ/[L:K]\ZZ</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Continuing to assume that <m>L/K</m> is finite unramified,
        let us now make the description of <m>H^2(L/K)</m> more canonical.
        Consider the short exact sequence
        <me>
          0 \to \ZZ \to \QQ \to \QQ/\ZZ \to 0
        </me>
        of modules with trivial Galois action.
        The module <m>\QQ</m> is injective as a <m>G</m>-module for any group <m>G</m>
        (<xref ref="exer-trivial-module-injective"/>);
        we thus get an isomorphism
        <me>
          H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), \ZZ) \cong H^{-1}_T(\Gal(L/K), \QQ/\ZZ) = \Hom(\Gal(L/K), \QQ/\ZZ)
        </me>.
        Since <m>\Gal(L/K)</m> has a canonical generator (Frobenius),
        we can evaluate there and get a canonical map 
        <me>
          \Hom(\Gal(L/K), \QQ/\ZZ) \to \ZZ/[L:K]\ZZ \subset \QQ/\ZZ
        </me>.
        Putting it all together, we get a canonical map
        <me>
          H^2(L/K) \cong H^0_T(L/K) \cong H^1(\Gal(L/K), \QQ/\ZZ) \hookrightarrow \QQ/\ZZ
        </me>.
        In this special case, this is none other than the local invariant map!
        In fact, by taking direct limits,
        we get a canonical isomorphism
        <me>
          H^2(K^{\unr}/K) \cong \QQ/\ZZ
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        What's really going on here is that
        <m>H^0_T(L/K)</m> is a cyclic group generated by a uniformizer <m>\pi</m> (since every unit is a norm).
        Under the map <m>H^0_T(L/K) \to \QQ/\ZZ</m>, that uniformizer is being mapped to <m>\frac{1}{[L:K]}</m>.

    <title>The cyclic case</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>L/K</m> be a cyclic but possibly ramified extension of local fields.
      Again, <m>H^1_T(L/K)</m> is trivial by <xref ref="L_theorem_90"/>,
      so all there is to compute is <m>H^0_T(L/K)</m>.
      We are going to show again that it has order <m>[L:K]</m>;
      recall that this alone is the key input for the use of abstract class field theory (<xref ref="subsec-abstract-cft-preview"/>).

    <lemma xml:id="L_open_subgroup_acyclic">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L/K</m> be a finite Galois extension of local fields.
          Then there is an open, Galois-stable subgroup <m>V</m> of <m>\gotho_L</m> such that
          <m>H^i(\Gal(L/K), V) = 0</m> for all <m>i>0</m> (i.e., <m>V</m> is acyclic for cohomology).
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          By the normal basis theorem, there exists <m>\alpha \in L</m> such that
          <m>\{\alpha^g\colon g \in \Gal(L/K)\}</m> is a basis for <m>L</m> over <m>K</m>.
          Without loss of generality, we may rescale to get <m>\alpha \in \gotho_L</m>;
          then put <m>V = \sum \gotho_K \alpha^g</m>.
          As in the proof of <xref ref="T_additive_theorem_90"/>,
          <m>V = \Ind^G_{1} \gotho_K</m> is induced and hence acyclic.

    <p>
      The following proof uses that we are in characteristic 0, but it can be modified to work also in the function field case.

    <lemma xml:id="L_open_subgroup_acyclic1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L/K</m> be a finite Galois extension of local fields.
          Then there is an open, Galois-stable subgroup <m>W</m> of

          Take <m>V</m> as in <xref ref="L_open_subgroup_acyclic"/>.
          If we choose <m>\alpha</m> sufficiently divisible,

            \exp(x) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{x^i}{i!}

    <proposition xml:id="P_inflation_restriction">
      <title>Inflation-restriction exact sequence</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> be a finite group, let <m>H</m> be a normal subgroup, and let <m>M</m> be a <m>G</m>-module.
          If <m>H^i(H, M) = 0</m> for <m>i=1, \dots, r-1</m>, then the sequence
          <me>
            0 \to H^r(G/H, M^H) \stackrel{\Inf}{\to} H^r(G,M) \stackrel{\Res}{\to} H^r(H,M)
          </me>
          is exact.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          For <m>r=1</m>, the condition on <m>H^i</m> is empty.
          In this case,
          <m>H^1(G,M)</m> classifies crossed homomorphisms <m>\phi\colon G \to M</m>.
          If one of these factors through <m>G/H</m>,
          it becomes a constant map when restricted to <m>H</m>;
          if that constant value itself belongs to <m>M^H</m>,
          then it must be zero and so the restriction to <m>H</m> is trivial.
          Conversely, if there exists some <m>m \in M</m> such that
          <m>\phi(h) = m^h - m</m> for all <m>h \in H</m>,
          then <m>\phi'(g) = \phi(g) - m^g + m</m> is another crossed homomorphism representing the same class in <m>H^1(G,M)</m>,
          but taking the value 0 on each <m>h \in H</m>.
          For <m>g \in G, h \in H</m>, we have
          <me>
            \phi'(hg) = \phi'(h)^g + \phi'(g) = \phi'(g)
          </me>,
          so <m>\phi'</m> is constant on cosets of <m>H</m> and so may be viewed as a crossed homomorphism from <m>G/H</m> to <m>M</m>.
          On the other hand,
          <me>
            \phi'(g) = \phi'(gh) = \phi'(g)^h + \phi(h) = \phi'(g)^h
          </me>
          so <m>\phi'</m> takes values in <m>M^H</m>.
          Thus the sequence is exact at <m>H^1(G,M)</m>;
          exactness at <m>H^i(G/H,M^H)</m> is similar but easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          If <m>r \gt 1</m>, we induct on <m>r</m> by dimension shifting.
          Recall (from <xref ref="P_adjoint_property"/>) that there is an injective homomorphism <m>M \to \Ind^G_1 \Res^G_1 M</m> of <m>G</m>-modules.
          Let <m>N</m> be the <m>G</m>-module which makes the sequence

          exact.
          We will prove the claim by constructing a commutative diagram

          In <xref ref="fig-localcomp-1"/>, 
          the second vertical arrow arises from the long exact sequence for <m>G</m>-cohomology;
          since <m>\Ind^G_{1} \Res^G_1 M</m> is an induced <m>G</m>-module,
          this arrow is an isomorphism.
          Similarly, the third vertical arrow arises from the long exact sequence for <m>H</m>-cohomology,
          and it is an isomorphism because
          <m>\Ind^G_1 \Res^G_1 M</m> is also an induced <m>H</m>-module;

          Finally, using the hypothesis on the vanishing of <m>H^i(H,M)</m>,

            0 \to M^H \to (\Ind^G_1 \Res^G_1 M)^H \to N^H \to H^1(H, M) = 0

          We may take the long exact sequence for <m>G/H</m>-cohomology to obtain the first vertical arrow;
          it is an isomorphism because
          <m>(\Ind^G_1 \Res^G_1 M)^H</m> is an induced <m>G/H</m>-module.
          More generally, for any abelian group <m>A</m>, we have an isomorphism <m>(\Ind^G_1 A)^H \cong \Ind^{G/H}_1 A</m> of <m>G/H</m>-modules.
          The point is that <m>Z[G/H] \cong Z[G]^H</m> via the map <m>[gH] \mapsto \sum_{h \in H} [gh]</m>.

          For any finite Galois extension <m>L/K</m> of local fields, the group <m>H^2(L/K)</m> has order at most <m>[L:K]</m>.

      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We've checked the case of <m>L/K</m> cyclic, so we may use it as the basis for an induction.
          If <m>L/K</m> is not cyclic, since it is solvable (<xref ref="rmk-local-galois-solvable"/>), we can find a Galois subextension <m>M/K</m>.
          Now the exact sequence

    <p>
      To complete the proof that <m>H^2(L/K)</m> is cyclic of order <m>[L:K]</m>,
      it now suffices to produce a cyclic subgroup of order <m>[L:K]</m>.
      We do this by comparing with an unramified extension of the same degree.

          Consequently (by <xref ref="P_H2_unramified"/> and <xref ref="C_inflation_restriction_h2"/>),

          Consider the diagram

                \xymatrix{
                  &amp; &amp; H^2(M/K) \ar[d]^{\Inf} \ar[rd] &amp;  \\
                  0 \ar[r] &amp; H^2(L/K) \ar^{\Inf}[r] &amp; H^2(ML/K) \ar^{\Res}[r] &amp; H^2(ML/L)
                }

          </figure>
          in which the bottom row is exact and the vertical arrow is injective,
          both by <xref ref="C_inflation_restriction_h2"/>.
          It suffices to show that the diagonal arrow <m>H^2(M/K) \to H^2(ML/L)</m> is the zero map,
          as this will imply an inclusion <m>H^2(M/K) \subseteq H^2(L/K)</m> within <m>H^2(ML/K)</m>
          and we already know that <m>H^2(M/K)</m> is cyclic of order <m>[M:K]=[L:K]</m>
          by <xref ref="P_H2_unramified"/>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>U/K</m> be the maximal unramified subextension of <m>L/K</m>; then <m>U/K</m> is also a subextension of <m>M/K</m>
          (because the latter is cyclic and there is a unique unramified extension of <m>K</m> of any given degree).
          We can thus enlarge our previous diagram to 
          <figure xml:id="fig-localcomp-5">
          <image>
          <latex-image>

          where the maps out of <m>H^2(U/K)</m> are again injective by <xref ref="C_inflation_restriction_h2"/>;
          moreover, the cokernel of <m>H^2(U/K) \stackrel{\Inf}{\to} H^2(M/K)</m> maps injectively via <m>\Res</m> into
          <m>H^2(M/U)</m>. This means that we can replace <m>K</m> by <m>U</m> before checking that the diagonal arrow is injective;
          in other words, we may safely assume that <m>L/K</m> is totally ramified.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, <m>L/K</m> and <m>M/K</m> are totally disjoint, so we have 
          a canonical isomorphism <m>\Gal(ML/L) \cong \Gal(M/K)</m> of cyclic groups.
          We may thus apply <em>ordinary</em> functoriality to the morphism <m>M^* \to (ML)^*</m> to obtain a map
          <m>H^2(M/K) \to H^2(ML/L)</m> which is exactly the one we want to be zero. By periodicity (<xref ref="T_cyclic_group_periodicity"/>)
          we may replace <m>H^2 = H^2_T</m> with <m>H^0_T</m> on both sides; we are then reduced to showing that the map
          <me>
            K^*/\Norm_{M/K} M^* \to L^*/\Norm_{ML/L} (ML)^*
          </me>
          is zero. Now <m>K^*/\Norm_{M/K} M^*</m> is a cyclic group of order <m>[L:K]</m> generated by <m>\pi_K</m>,
          a uniformizer of <m>K</m>,
          and <m>L^*/\Norm_{ML/L} (ML)^*</m> is a cyclic group of order <m>[L:K]</m> generated by <m>\pi_L</m>,
          a uniformizer of <m>L</m>.
          But because <m>L/K</m> is totally ramified, <m>\pi_K</m> is a unit of
          <m>\gotho_L</m> times <m>\pi_L^{[L:K]}</m>,
          so the map in question is indeed zero.

    <title>The local invariant map</title>
    <p>
      We have now proved the first assertion of <xref ref="P_local_h2"/> (by combining <xref ref="P_H2_upper_bound"/> and <xref ref="P_H2_lower_bound"/>).
      We now turn to the second assertion. In the process, we will also see that <m>H^2(\overline{K}/K) \cong \QQ/\ZZ</m>.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="L_local_invariant_map">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any Galois extension <m>L/K</m> of local fields, the group <m>H^2(L/K)</m> can be canonically identified with
          <m>\frac{1}{[L:K]}\ZZ/\ZZ</m> in such a way that if <m>M/K</m> is another Galois extension containing <m>L</m>,
          the inflation homomorphism <m>H^2(L/K) \to H^2(M/K)</m> corresponds to the inclusion <m>\frac{1}{[L:K]}\ZZ/\ZZ \subseteq \frac{1}{[M:K]}\ZZ/\ZZ</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="C_inflation_restriction_h2"/> we have an injection
          <m>H^2(K^{\unr}/K) \to H^2(\overline{K}/K)</m>, and the former is canonically isomorphic to <m>\QQ/\ZZ</m>;
          so we have to prove that this injection is actually also surjective.
          Remember that <m>H^2(\overline{K}/K)</m> is the direct limit of
          <m>H^2(L/K)</m> running over all finite extensions <m>L</m> of <m>K</m>.
          By <xref ref="P_H2_lower_bound"/>, if <m>L/K</m> is a finite extension and
          <m>M</m> is the unramified extension of <m>K</m> of degree <m>[L:K]</m>,
          then the images of <m>H^2(L/K)</m> and <m>H^2(M/K)</m> in <m>H^2(ML/K)</m> are the same.
          In particular, <m>H^2(L/K)</m> is in the image of the map <m>H^2(K^{\unr}/K) \to H^2(\overline{K}/K)</m>.
          Since that's true for any <m>L</m>,
          we get that the map is indeed surjective, hence an isomorphism.
