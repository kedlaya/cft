    <title>The local reciprocity law</title>
    <p>
      The main theorem of local class field theory is the following.
    </p>
    <definition>
    <p>
      For <m>K</m> a local field,
      let <m>K^{\ab}</m> be the maximal abelian extension of <m>K</m>.

    <theorem xml:id="T_local_reciprocity">
      <title>Local Reciprocity Law</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>K</m> be a local field.
          Then there is a unique map
          <m>\phi_K\colon K^* \to \Gal(K^{\ab}/K)</m> satisfying the following conditions:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                for any uniformizer <m>\pi</m> of <m>K</m> and any finite unramified extension <m>L</m> of <m>K</m>,
                <m>\phi_K(\pi)</m> acts on <m>L</m> as the Frobenius automorphism;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                for any finite abelian extension <m>L</m> of <m>K</m>,
                the group of norms <m>\Norm_{L/K} L^*</m> is in the kernel of <m>\phi_K</m>,
                and the induced map <m>K^*/\Norm_{L/K} L^* \to \Gal(L/K)</m> is an isomorphism.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          See the discussion in <xref ref="sec_tatethm"/>,
          particularly <xref ref="rem-assemble-local-reciprocity"/> and <xref ref="rem-assemble-local-reciprocity-compatibility"/>.

      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <definition>
      <p>
        The map <m>\phi_K</m> in <xref ref="T_local_reciprocity"/> is variously called the
        <term>local reciprocity map</term>
        or the <term>norm residue symbol</term>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <example xml:id="exa-local-recip-Qp">
      <p>
        Using the local Kronecker-Weber theorem
        (<xref ref="T_local_Kronecker-Weber1"/>),
        the statement of <xref ref="T_local_reciprocity"/> can be explicitly verified for <m>K=\QQ_p</m>.
        To wit, we have <m>K^{\ab} = K_1 K_2</m> where <m>K_1 = \bigcup_n \QQ_p(\zeta_{p^n})</m>
        and <m>K_2 = \bigcup_n \QQ_p(\zeta_{p^n-1})</m>, and 
        <m>\Gal(K^{\ab}/K) \cong \Gal(K_1/K) \times \Gal(K_2/K)</m>.
        Since <m>p</m> is totally ramified in <m>K_1</m>, we have 
        <me>
          \Gal(K_1/K) \cong \Gal(\QQ(\zeta_{p^\infty})/\QQ) \cong \ZZ_p^*
        </me>.
        Since <m>p</m> is unramified in <m>K_2</m>, we have
        <me>
        \Gal(K_2/K) \cong \Gal(\overline{\FF}_p/\FF_p) \cong \widehat{\ZZ}
        </me>.
        However, it will be more convenient to think of the image as sitting inside
        <me>
        \Gal(\bigcup_n \QQ(\zeta_{p^n-1})/\QQ) \cong \widehat{\ZZ}^*/\ZZ_p^* \cong \prod_{q \neq p} \ZZ_q^*
        </me>
        (here using global Kronecker-Weber and Artin reciprocity).
        That is, we are looking for a map
        <me>
          \phi_K\colon \ZZ_p^* \times p^{\ZZ} \cong \QQ_p^* \to \Gal(K_1/K) \times \Gal(K_2/K) \subset \ZZ_p^* \times \prod_{q \neq p} \ZZ_q^*
        </me>;
        the map we want is the identity on the first factor and the map <m>p \mapsto p</m> on the second factor. See <xref ref="exer-Qp-reciprocity-map"/>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <p>
      The local reciprocity law is an analogue of the Artin reprocity law for number fields.
      We also get an analogue of the existence of ray class fields.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_local_existence">
      <title>Local existence theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>K</m> be a local field.
          For every finite (not necessarily abelian) extension <m>L</m> of <m>K</m>,
          <m>\Norm_{L/K} L^*</m> is an open subgroup of <m>K^*</m> of finite index.
          Conversely, for every (open) subgroup <m>U</m> of <m>K^*</m> of finite index,
          there exists a finite abelian extension <m>L</m> of <m>K</m> such that <m>U = \Norm_{L/K} L^*</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          For the first assertion, see <xref ref="exer-norm-subgroup-is-open"/> 
          (or <xref ref="exer-norm-subgroup-is-open-charp"/> for the case of characteristic <m>p</m>).
          For the second assertion, see <xref ref="T_local_existence2"/>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <remark xml:id="rem-subspace-topology">
      <p>
        In <xref ref="T_local_existence"/>, the topology on <m>K^*</m> is the one given by taking the disjoint union of the sets
        <m>\pi^n \gotho_K^*</m> for <m>n \in \ZZ</m>, where <m>\pi \in K^\times</m> is a uniformizer. 
        In fact, it is only necessary to keep track of this topology in the function field case;
        for <m>K</m> a finite extension of <m>\QQ_p</m>, one can show that every subgroup of <m>K^*</m> of finite index is open.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way to identify the correct topology on <m>K^*</m> is to equip <m>K</m> with its usual topology (the norm topology defined by an extension of
        the <m>p</m>-adic absolute value) and then take the subspace topology for the inclusion of <m>K^*</m> into <m>K \times K</m> given by
        <m>x \mapsto (x, x^{-1})</m>. While this does coincide with the subspace topology for the inclusion of <m>K^*</m> into <m>K</m>, there are good reasons
        not to view it this way; see <xref ref="exer-subspace-top"/>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      The local existence theorem says that if we start with a nonabelian extension <m>L</m>,
      then <m>\Norm_{L/K} L^*</m> is also the group of norms of an abelian extension.
      But which one? The following theorem gives the answer.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_norm_limitation">
      <title>Norm limitation theorem</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>L/K</m> be a (not necessarily Galois) extension of local fields.
            Let <m>M</m> be the maximal abelian subextension of <m>L/K</m>.
            Then <m>\Norm_{L/K} L^* = \Norm_{M/K} M^*</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <proof>
          <p>
            See the discussion in <xref ref="sec_tatethm"/>,
            particularly <xref ref="rem-deduce-local-norm-limitation"/>.
          </p>
        </proof>
    </theorem>
    <remark>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="T_norm_limitation"/>, we have <m>\Norm_{L/K} L^* \subseteq \Norm_{M/K} M^*</m> because
        <me>
          \Norm_{L/K} = \Norm_{M/K} \circ \Norm_{L/M}
        </me>. 
        Since the group <m>\Norm_{L/K} L^*</m> can be shown directly to be an open subgroup of finite index 
        (see <xref ref="exer-norm-subgroup-is-open"/>), <xref ref="T_local_existence"/> implies that it has the form <m>\Norm_{N/K} N^*</m> for some finite abelian 
        extension <m>N</m> of <m>K</m>. <xref ref="T_local_reciprocity"/> then implies that <m>M \subseteq N</m>. The subtle point that remains to be proven is that
        the inclusion <m>M \subseteq N</m> is actually an equality.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark xml:id="rem-Lubin-Tate-splitting">
      <p>
        Let <m>K</m> be a local field.
        For each uniformizer <m>\pi</m> of <m>K</m>,
        let <m>K_\pi</m> be the composite of all finite abelian extensions <m>L</m> such that <m>\pi \in \Norm_{L/K} L^*</m>.
        Then the local reciprocity map implies that <m>K^{\ab} = K_\pi \cdot K^{\unr}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It turns out that <m>K_\pi</m> can be explicitly constructed as the extension of <m>K</m> by certain elements,
        thus giving a generalization of local Kronecker-Weber to arbitrary local fields!
        These elements come from <term>Lubin-Tate formal groups</term>,
        which we will not discuss further.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      Note that for <m>L/K</m> a finite extension of local fields, the map
      <me>
        K^*/\Norm_{L/K} L^* \to \Gal(L/K) = G
      </me>
      obtained by combining the local reciprocity law with the norm limitation theorem is in fact an isomorphism of
      <m>G = G^{\ab} = H^{-2}_T(G, \ZZ)</m> with <m>K^*/\Norm_{L/K} L^* = H^0_T(G, L^*)</m>.
      We will in fact show something stronger,
      from which we will deduce both the local reciprocity law and the norm limitation theorem.

    <title>The local invariant map</title>

      We will first prove the following.

      <p>
        In <xref ref="T_Brauer_group_identification"/>, the first map is an inflation homomorphism;

          \inv_{L/K}\colon H^2(\Gal(L/K), L^*) \to \frac{1}{n}\ZZ/\ZZ
        </me>,
        and these isomorphisms are compatible with inflation.
        (In particular, we don't need to prove the first isomorphism separately.

    <remark xml:id="subsec-abstract-cft-preview">
      <p>
        Having derived local class field theory once,
        we will do it again a slightly different way in <xref ref="ch_abstract"/>.
        In the course of proving the above results,
        we will show (among other things) that if <m>L/K</m> is a cyclic extension of local fields,
        <me>
          \#H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), L^*) = [L:K], \qquad \#H^{-1}_T(\Gal(L/K), L^*) = 1

      <p>
        It turns out that this alone is enough number-theoretic input to prove local class field theory!
        More precisely,
        we will identify <q>minimal</q> properties of a field <m>K</m> with <m>G = \Gal(\overline{K}/K)</m>,
        a surjective continuous homomorphism <m>d\colon G \to \widehat{\ZZ}</m> (defining <q>unramified</q> extensions of <m>K</m>),
        a continuous <m>G</m>-module <m>A</m> (playing the role of <m>\overline{K}^*</m>),
        and a homomorphism <m>v\colon A^G \to \widehat{\ZZ}</m> (playing the role of the valuation map)

           Show that <m>K^*</m> can be viewed as a closed subspace of <m>K \times K</m> via the inclusion <m>x \mapsto (x,x^{-1})</m>,
           and deduce from this that <m>K^*</m> is a locally compact abelian group for the subspace topology.
           It can also be viewed as a subspace of <m>K</m>, but not as a closed subspace; this distinction will show up more seriously when we talk about 
           ad&#xe8;les and id&#xe8;les (<xref ref="rmk-idele-topology"/>).
