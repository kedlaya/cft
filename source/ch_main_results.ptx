  <title>The main results</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We finally embark on the proof of the main results of global class field theory, via the adelic reformulation
      (<xref ref="sec_adelic-recip"/>) and specifically the outline from <xref ref="sec_adelic-overview"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As explained in the preface,
      the reader who has arrived at this point having skipped <xref ref="ch_abstract"/> still has the ability to obtain complete proofs of the main results.
      To do so, read <xref ref="sec_ideles-cohom1"/> and <xref ref="sec_ideles-cohom2"/> in their entirety
      (for the First Inequality and the Second Inequality);
      then skip ahead to <xref ref="sec_brauer"/> (for local-to-global compatibility, the reciprocity isomorphism,
      and the norm limitation theorem); then return to <xref ref="sec_existence"/> (for the existence theorem).
