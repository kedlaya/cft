      We next specialize attention to the case of a finite <em>cyclic</em> group, which will play a key role in many of our calculations.
      In this case, the cohomology, homology, and Tate groups satisfy a key periodicity property (<xref ref="T_cyclic_group_periodicity"/>) which allows us to define and manipulate a sort of
      <q>Euler characteristic</q>, the <term>Herbrand quotient</term> (<xref ref="def-Herbrand-quotient"/>).

    <title>The periodicity theorem</title>
    <p>
      In general, for any given <m>G</m> and <m>M</m>,
      it is at worst a tedious exercise (or a computer calculation) to compute
      <m>H^i_T(G,M)</m> for any single value of <m>i</m>,
      but try to compute all of these at once and you discover that they exhibit very little evident structure.
      Thankfully, there is an exception to that dreary rule when <m>G</m> is cyclic.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_cyclic_group_periodicity">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> be a finite cyclic group and <m>M</m> a <m>G</m>-module.
          Then there is a functorial isomorphism <m>H^i_T(G,M) \to H^{i+2}_T(G,M)</m> for all <m>i \in \ZZ</m>;
          moreover, these isomorphisms are all determined by the choice of a generator of <m>G</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>m</m> be the order of <m>G</m>,
          choose a generator <m>g</m> of <m>G</m>, and fix the identification of the group ring <m>\ZZ[G]</m> with the (commutative!)
          ring <m>\ZZ[x]/(x^m-1)</m> taking <m>g</m> to <m>x</m>.
          I can then view multiplication by <m>x-1</m> as a map of <m>G</m>-modules <m>\ZZ[G] \to \ZZ[G]</m>,
          then tensor over <m>\ZZ</m> with <m>M</m> to get a map
          <me>
            \Ind^G_1 \Res^G_1 M \stackrel{\times (x-1)}{\to} \Ind^G_1 \Res^G_1 M
          </me>.
          The kernel of this map is the image of multiplication by <m>x^{m-1} + \cdots + 1</m>,
          while the image is the ideal generated by <m>x-1</m>. Consequently, if I extend this map to a sequence
          <me>
            0 \to M \to \Ind^G_1 \Res^G_1 M \stackrel{\times (x-1)}{\to} \Ind^G_1 \Res^G_1 M \to M \to 0
          </me>
          by adding the adjunction maps on both sides, the result is exact.
        </p>
        <p>
          By Shapiro's lemma, the Tate groups of the two modules in the middle are all zero.
          The desired result now follows from the following general fact: if
          <me>
            0 \to A \stackrel{f}{\to} B \stackrel{g}{\to} C \stackrel{h}{\to} D \to 0
          </me>
          is exact and <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> have all Tate groups zero,
          then there is a canonical isomorphism <m>H^{i+2}_T(G, A) \to H^i_T(G, D)</m>.
          To see this,
          form the long exact sequence associated to the short exact sequences
          <md>
            <mrow>0 \to A \to B \to \frac{B}{\im(f)} \to 0</mrow>
            <mrow>0 \to \frac{B}{\ker(g)} \to C \to D \to 0</mrow>
          </md>
          and combine the resulting isomorphisms to get
          <me>
            H^{i+2}(G, A) \cong H^{i+1}\left(G, \frac{B}{\im(f)}\right) = H^{i+1}\left(G, \frac{B}{\ker(g)}\right) \cong H^i(G,D).
          </me>
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <remark>
      <p>
        In particular, when <m>G</m> is cyclic, the long exact sequence of a short exact sequence
        <m>0 \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0</m> of <m>G</m>-modules curls up into an exact hexagon
        as in <xref ref="fig-homology-2"/>.

    <title>Herbrand quotients</title>
    <definition xml:id="def-Herbrand-quotient">
      <p>
        Let <m>G</m> be a finite cyclic group and let <m>M</m> be a <m>G</m>-module.
        If the groups <m>H^i_T(G, M)</m> are finite,
        we define the <term>Herbrand quotient</term> as the ratio
        <me>
          h(M) = \#H^0_T(G,M) / \#H^{-1}_T(G, M).
        </me>
        From the exactness of the hexagon in <xref ref="fig-homology-2"/>,
        we see that if <m>M', M, M''</m> all have Herbrand quotients, then
        <me>
          h(M) = h(M') h(M'').
        </me>
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Expanding on the previous point, if two of <m>M', M, M''</m> have Herbrand quotients, then so does the third.
        For example, if <m>M'</m> and <m>M''</m> have Herbrand quotients,
        i.e., their Tate groups are finite,
        then we have an exact sequence
        <me>
          H^{-1}_T(G, M') \to H^{-1}_T(G, M) \to H^{-1}_T(G, M'')
        </me>
        and the outer groups are all finite.
        In particular,
        the first map is out of a finite group and so has finite image,
        and modulo that image,
        <m>H^{-1}_T(G,M)</m> injects into another finite group.
        So it's also finite, and so on.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
        In practice,
        it will often be much easier to compute the Herbrand quotient of a <m>G</m>-module than to compute either of its Tate groups directly.
        The Herbrand quotient will then do half of the work for free:
        once one group is computed directly,
        at least the order of the other will be automatically known.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
        If <m>M</m> is finite, then the groups <m>H^i_T(G,M)</m> are finite and <m>h(M) = 1</m>.
        To wit, the sequences
        <md>
          <mrow>0 \to M^G \to M \to M \to M_G \to 0</mrow>
          <mrow>0 \to H^{-1}_T(G,M) \to M_G \stackrel{\Norm_G}{\to} M^G \to H^0_T(G,M) \to 0</mrow>
        </md>
        are exact, where <m>M \to M</m> is the map <m>m \mapsto m^g - m</m>;
        thus <m>M_G</m> and <m>M^G</m> are finite groups of the same order,
        as then are <m>H^{-1}_T</m> and <m>H^0_T</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
        We already <q>almost</q> know that the groups <m>H^i(G,M)</m> are finite: by extended functoriality
        (<xref ref="exa-extended-functoriality"/>), we know they are torsion with exponent dividing <m>\#G</m>.
        The only issue is then that they could fail to be finitely generated.

      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
            The periodicity of the Tate groups for <m>G</m> cyclic means that there is a canonical
            (up to the choice of a generator of <m>G</m>)
            isomorphism between <m>H^{-1}_T(G, M)</m> and <m>H^1_T(G,M)</m>,
            i.e., between <m>\ker(\Norm_G)/MI_G</m> and the set of equivalence classes of 1-cocycles.
            What is this isomorphism explicitly?
            In other words, given an element of <m>\ker(\Norm_G)/MI_G</m>,
            what is the corresponding 1-cocycle?

            Let <m>G = S_3</m>
            (the symmetric group on three letters),
            let <m>M = \ZZ^3</m> with the natural <m>G</m>-action permuting the factors,

            Compute <m>H^i(G, M/N)</m> for <m>i=1,2</m> however you want:
            you can explicitly compute cochains,
            use the alternate interpretations given above,
            or use the exact sequence <m>0 \to N \to M \to M/N \to 0</m>.
            Better yet, use more than one method and make sure that you get the same answer.

        <hint>
          <p>
            Part of the point of this exercise is that even in this relatively simple-looking situation, it is not all that easy to do the computation.
            One approach that minimizes the computational complexity is to use the <term>Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence</term> 
            (see <xref ref="bib-Milne-CFT"/>, Remark II.1.35) to reduce to working with the cyclic groups
            <m>H = A_3 \cong \ZZ/3\ZZ</m> and <m>G/H = S_3/A_3 \cong \ZZ/2\ZZ</m>, for which periodicity is applicable.
