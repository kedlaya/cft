      You may not be surprised to learn that there is a <q>dual</q> theory to the theory of group cohomology, namely group homology.
      What you may be surprised to learn is that one can actually fit the two together,
      so that in a sense the homology groups become cohomology groups with negative indices.
      (Since the arguments are similar to those for cohomology, I'm going to skip some details.)
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>Homology</title>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Let <m>M_G</m> denote the maximal quotient of <m>M</m> on which <m>G</m> acts trivially.
        In other words,
        <m>M_G</m> is the quotient of <m>M</m> by the submodule spanned by <m>m^g-m</m> for all <m>m \in M</m> and <m>g \in G</m>.
        In yet other words, <m>M_G = M/M I_G</m>,
        where <m>I_G</m> is the <term>augmentation ideal</term>
        of the group algebra <m>\ZZ[G]</m>:
        <me>
          I_G = \left\{\sum_{g \in G} z_g[g]: \sum_g z_g = 0\right\}.
        </me>
        Or if you like, <m>M_G = M \otimes_{\ZZ[G]} \ZZ</m>.
        Since <m>M^G</m> is the group of <m>G</m>-invariants,
        we call <m>M_G</m> the group of
        <term><m>G</m>-coinvariants</term>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The functor <m>M \to M^G</m> is right exact but not left exact:
      if <m>0 \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0</m>,
      then <m>M'_G \to M_G \to M''_G \to 0</m> is exact but the map on the left is not injective.
      Again, we can fill in the exact sequence by defining homology groups.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        A <m>G</m>-module <m>M</m> is <term>projective</term>
        if for any surjection <m>N \to N'</m> of <m>G</m>-modules and any map <m>\phi: M \to N'</m>,
        there exists a map <m>\psi: M \to N</m> lifting <m>\phi</m>.
        This definition is dual to the definition of an injective <m>G</m>-module, but this symmetry is a bit misleading:
        it is much easier to find projectives than injectives.
        For example,  any <m>G</m>-module which is a free module over the ring <m>\ZZ[G]</m> is projective
        such as <m>\ZZ[G]</m> itself!
      </p>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <p>
        A <term>projective resolution</term> of <m>M</m> is an exact sequence
        <m>\cdots \to P_1 \to P_0 \to M \to 0</m> of <m>G</m>-modules
        in which the <m>P_i</m> are projective.
        Given such a resolution,
        take coinvariants to get a complex
        <me>
          \cdots \stackrel{d_2}{\to} P_2 \stackrel{d_1}{\to} P_1 \stackrel{d_0}{\to} P_0 \to 0,
        </me>
        then put <m>H_i(G, M) = \ker(d_{i-1})/\im(d_i)</m>.
        Again, this is canonically independent of the resolution and functorial,
        and there is a long exact sequence which starts out
        <me>
          \cdots \to H_1(G, M'') \stackrel{\delta}{\to} H_0(G, M') \to H_0(G, M) \to H_0(G, M'') \to 0.
        </me>
      </p>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <p>
        We say that <m>M</m> is <term>acyclic (for homology)</term> if 
        <m>H_i(G,M) =0</m> for <m>i>0</m>.
        As with group cohomology, we can replace a projective resolution with an acyclic resolution and get the same homology groups.
        For example, induced modules are again acyclic and the analogue of Shapiro's lemma holds
        (key point: any free <m>\ZZ[H]</m>-module induces to a free <m>\ZZ[G]</m>-module).
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-first-homology">
      <p>
        One can give a concrete description of homology as well,
        but we won't need it for our purposes.
        Even without one, though,
        we can calculate <m>H_1(G, \ZZ)</m>, using the exact sequence
        <me>
          0 \to I_G \to \ZZ[G] \to \ZZ \to 0
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the long exact sequence in homology,
        <me>
          0 = H_1(G, \ZZ[G]) \to H_1(G, \ZZ) \to H_0(G, I_G) \to H_0(G, \ZZ[G])
        </me>
        is exact, i.e.
        <m>0 \to H_1(G, \ZZ) \to I_G/I_G^2 \to \ZZ[G]/I_G</m> is exact.
        The last map is induced by
        <m>I_G \hookrightarrow \ZZ[G]</m> and so is the zero map.
        Thus <m>H_1(G, \ZZ) \cong I_G/I_G^2</m>;
        recall that in <xref ref="exc-augmentation"/>,
        it was shown that the map <m>g \mapsto [g] - 1</m> defines an isomorphism <m>G^{\ab} \to I_G/I_G^2</m>.
        This can be thought of as an algebraic analogue of the fact that the first homology group of a (reasonable)
        topological space equals the abelianization of the fundamental group.

    <title>The Tate groups</title>
    <p>
      We now
      <q>fit together</q>
      the long exact sequences of cohomology and homology to get a doubly infinite exact sequence.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Let <m>M</m> be a <m>G</m>-module.
        Define the map <m>\Norm_G: M \to M</m> by
        <me>
          \Norm_G(m) = \sum_{g \in G} m^g.
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then <m>\Norm_G</m> induces a homomorphism
        <me>
          \Norm_G: H_0(G,M) = M_G \to M^G = H^0(G,M).
        </me>
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        You might be wondering why <m>\Norm_G</m> is called a <q>norm</q> rather than a <q>trace</q>.
        The reason is that in practice, our modules <m>M</m> will most often be groups which are most naturally written
        multiplicatively, e.g., the nonzero elements of a field.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <definition>
      <p>
        We now define the <term>Tate cohomology groups</term> (or <term>Tate homology groups</term> if you prefer) as follows:
        <me>
          H_T^i = \begin{cases}H^i(G, M) \amp  i > 0 \\ M^G/\Norm_G M \amp  i=0 \\ \ker(\Norm_G)/MI_G \amp  i=-1 \\ H_{-i-1}(G,M) \amp  i\lt -1. \end{cases}
        </me>
      </p>
      </definition>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
        For any short exact sequence
        <m>0 \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0</m> of <m>G</m>-modules, we have a canonical exact sequence
        <me>
          \cdots \to H^{i-1}_T(G, M'') \to H^i_T(G, M') \to H^i_T(G, M) \to H^i_T(G, M'') \to H^{i+1}_T(G, M') \to \cdots
        </me>
        which extends infinitely in both directions.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Since we already have long exact sequences for homology and cohomology, the only remaining issue is exactness between
          <m>H^{-2}_T(G, M'')</m> and <m>H^1_T(G, M')</m> inclusive.
          This follows by diagram-chasing, as in the proof of the snake lemma (<xref ref="L_snake_lemma"/>)
          on the commutative diagram <xref ref="fig-homology-1"/>
          with exact rows, noting that the diagram remains commutative with the dashed arrows added.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>

      <p>
        If <m>M</m> is an induced <m>G</m>-module,
        then <m>H^i_T(G,M) = 0</m> for all <m>i</m> (see <xref ref="exer-induced-acyclic-Tate"/>. 
        That is, induced modules are acyclic for all of cohomology, homology, and Tate (co)homology.

    <title>Extended functoriality revisited</title>
    <p>
      The extended functoriality for cohomology groups (<xref ref="D-extended-functoriality"/>) has analogues for homology groups and Tate cohomology groups,
      but under more restrictive conditions.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="D-extended-functoriality-homology">
      <p>
        Again, let <m>M</m> be a <m>G</m>-module and <m>M'</m> a <m>G'</m>-module,
        and consider a homomorphism
        <m>\alpha: G' \to G</m> of groups and a homomorphism
        <m>\beta: M \to M'</m> of abelian which are compatible in the sense of <xref ref="D-extended-functoriality"/>.
        We would like to obtain canonical homomorphisms
        <m>H_i(G, M) \to H_i(G', M')</m>,
        but for this we need to add an additional condition to ensure that
        <m>M \to M'</m> induces a well-defined map <m>M_G \to M'_{G'}</m>.
        For instance, this holds if <m>\alpha</m> is surjective.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Tate cohomology groups, there is a further complication that the map <m>M^G \to (M')^{G'}</m> does not necessarily induce
        a map <m>\Norm(M) \to \Norm(M')</m>. However, this does occur if <m>\alpha</m> is injective, so for instance we have well-defined
        restriction maps <m>\Res: H^0_T(G, M) \to H^0_T(H, M)</m> whenever <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-torsion-H0T">
      <p>
        In <xref ref="exa-extended-functoriality"/>, we used the restriction and corestriction maps to show that for <m>G</m> a finite group and
        <m>M</m> a <M>G</M>-module, the groups <m>H^i(G, M)</m> are torsion groups killed by <m>\#G</m> for all <m>i > 0</m>.
        While we cannot extend the corestriction map to Tate cohomology, we may still argue directly that <m>H^0_T(G, M)</m> is killed by <m>\#G</m>.
