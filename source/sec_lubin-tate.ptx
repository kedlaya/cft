    <title>Formal group laws</title>
    <p>
      The idea here is to imitate Kronecker-Weber by identifying some kind of group object whose torsion points generate abelian extensions
      of a local field. We define the group object first.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-one-param-formal-group">
      <p>
        A <term>one-parameter commutative formal group law</term> over a commutative ring <m>A</m> is a formal power series
        <m>F \in A \llbracket X,Y \rrbracket</m> such that:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <m>F \equiv X + Y \pmod{(X,Y)^2}</m>;
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>F(X, F(Y,Z)) = F(F(X,Y),Z)</m> (associativity);
          </li>
          <li>
            there exists a unique series <m>i_F \in X A \llbracket X \rrbracket</m> such that <m>F(X, i_F(X)) = 0</m> (existence of inverses);
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>F(X,Y) = F(Y,X)</m> (commutativity).
          </li>
        </ol>
        Note that throughout this definition, we are using the fact that we can substitute a power series 
        with constant term 0 (in any number of variables) into another power series to get a meaningful result.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose now that <m>A = \gotho_K</m> where <m>K</m> is a local field. Then we can also substitute elements of the maximal ideal <m>\gothm_K</m>
        into <m>F</m>, and this will define an exotic group structure on this set.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <p>
        Take <m>F = X + Y</m> (the <term>formal additive group</term>). When <m>A = \gotho_K</m>, this recovers the usual group structure on <m>\gothm_K</m>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <p>
        Take <m>F = X+Y+XY</m> (the <term>formal multiplicative group</term>). When <m>A = \gotho_K</m>, this corresponds to the group structure on <m>1+\gothm_K</m>
        via the bijection <m>x \mapsto x+1</m> from <m>\gothm_K</m> to <m>1+\gothm_K</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

  <subsection>
    <title>Lubin-Tate formal groups</title>
    <p>
      We next introduce a condition on a formal group law analogous to complex multiplication for an elliptic curve.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Let <m>F_1, F_2</m> be a formal group law over a ring <m>A</m>. A <term>homomorphism</term> from <m>F_1</m> to <m>F_2</m>
        is a power series <m>h \in T A \llbracket T \rrbracket</m> such that 
        <me>
          h(F_1(X,Y)) = F_2(h(X), h(Y))
        </me>.
        When <m>F_1 = F_2 = F</m> we call this an <term>endomorphism</term> of <m>F</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a natural notion of <term>addition</term> of endomorphisms: if <m>f_1</m> and <m>f_2</m> are endomorphisms of <m>F</m>,
        then so is
        <me>
          f_1 +_F f_2 = F(f_1, f_2)
        </me>.
        There is also a notion of <term>multiplication</term> of endomorphisms, which coincides with composition of formal power series.
        In particular this is in general not commutative.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <p>
        For any formal group law <m>F</m>, there exist unique endomorphisms <m>[n]</m> for <m>n \in \ZZ</m> such that:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <m>[0] = 0</m> and <m>[1] = T</m>;
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>[n_1] + [n_2] = [n_1 + n_2]</m>;
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>[n_1] \circ [n_2] = [n_1 n_2]</m>.
          </li>

          Let <m>K</m> be a local field with residue field of order <m>q</m> and fix a generator <m>\pi</m> of <m>\gothm_K</m>.
          For any two <m>f,g \in \calF_\pi</m>,
          for any homogeneous linear polynomial <m>\phi_1</m> in the variables <m>X_1,\dots,X_n</m> over <m>\gotho_K</m>,
          there exists a unique power series <m>\phi \in \gotho_K \llbracket X_1,\dots,X_n \rrbracket</m>
          such that:

            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Writing <m>\phi = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \phi_i</m> where <m>\phi_i</m> is homogeneous of degree <m>i</m>,
          we construct the <m>\phi_i</m> inductively. Suppose that <m>\phi_1,\dots,\phi_i</m> are already specified (initially with <m>i=1</m>), 
          and set <m>\phi_{\leq i} = \phi_1 + \cdots + \phi_i</m>.
          By looking at Taylor expansions, we obtain
          <md>
            <mrow>
              f((\phi_{\leq_i} + \phi_{i+1})(X_1, \dots, X_N)) &amp;\equiv f(\phi_{\leq i}(X_1,\dots,X_n)) + \pi \phi_{i+1} \pmod{(X_1,\dots,X_n)^{i+2}}
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              (\phi_{\leq_i} + \phi_{i+1})(g(X_1),\dots,g(X_n)) &amp;\equiv \phi_{\leq i}(g(X_1),\dots,g(X_n)) + \pi^{i+1} \phi_{i+1} \pmod{(X_1,\dots,X_n)^{i+2}}
            </mrow>
          </md>.
          This means that we must ensure that
          <me>
            \phi_{i+1} \equiv \frac{f(\phi_{\leq i}(X_1,\dots,X_n)) - \phi_{\leq i}(g(X_1),\dots,g(X_n))}{(\pi^i-1)\pi} \pmod{(X_1,\dots,X_n)^{i+2}}.
          </me>
          But in fact the numerator of the fraction is divisible by <m>\pi</m>: modulo <m>\pi</m> both <m>f</m>
          and <m>g</m> are congruent to <m>T^q</m> and this map is a ring homomorphism.
          We thus obtain a unique choice of <m>\phi_{i+1}</m> that allows the construction to continue.

          Let <m>K</m> be a local field with residue field of order <m>q</m> and fix a generator <m>\pi</m> of <m>\gothm_K</m>.
          For any <m>f \in \calF_\pi</m>,
          there exists a unique formal group <m>F</m> over <m>\gotho_K</m> admitting <m>f</m> as an endomorphism.
          Moreover, for every <m>a \in \gotho_K</m>, <m>F</m> admits a unique endomorphism <m>[a] \equiv a T \pmod{T^2}</m>
          which commutes with <m>f</m> (in particular, <m>[\pi] = f</m>), and these satisfy
          <me>
            [a+b] = [a] +_F [b], \qquad [ab] = [a] \circ [b]

      <proof>
        <p>
          We get <m>F</m> by applying <xref ref="prop-formal-group-with-endomorphism"/> with <m>g=f</m> and <m>\phi_1(X,Y) = X+Y</m>.
          Since <m>\phi_1(X,Y)</m> also equals <m>Y+X</m>, the uniqueness aspect of <xref ref="prop-formal-group-with-endomorphism"/> implies commutativity.
          We deduce existence of inverses by similarly taking <m>\phi_1(X) = -X</m>. 
          We deduce associativity by similarly taking <m>\phi_1(X,Y,Z) = X+Y+Z</m> and invoking the uniqueness aspect.
          We produce <m>[a]</m> by similarly taking <m>\phi_1(X) = aX</m>; we check that <m>[a+b] = [a] +_F [b]</m> and <m>[ab] = [a] \circ [b]</m>
          by invoking the uniqueness aspect.
          (Compare <xref ref="bib-Milne-CFT"/>, Proposition I.2.12 and I.2.14.)

    <remark>
      <p>
        For each <m>f \in \calF_\pi</m>, we can find a unit <m>u \in \gotho_K \llbracket T \rrbracket^\times</m> with <m>u \equiv 1 \pmod{\pi}</m>
        such that <m>uf</m> (which is also in <m>\calF_\pi)</m> is a monic polynomial of degree <m>q</m>. This follows for example from the Weierstrass preparation theorem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, if we were to relax the second condition in <xref ref="def_LT_candidate_endo"/> to require only that <m>f \equiv T^q \pmod{\pi, T^{q+1}}</m>,
        then we could again always find a unit <m>u \in \gotho_K \llbracket T \rrbracket^\times</m> with <m>u \equiv 1 \pmod{\pi,T}</m>
        such that <m>uf</m> is a monic polynomial of degree <m>q</m>. (This relaxation would correspond to the definition of the <term>height</term>
        of a formal group.)

        we get a canonical isomorphism <m>\Lambda_f \cong \Lambda_g</m> of <m>\gotho_K</m>-modules; in particular, this isomorphism is compatible
        with the action of <m>\Gal(\overline{K}/K)</m>.
        This lets us simplify some arguments by reducing to the case where <m>f</m> is a polynomial, or even to the case <m>f = \pi T + T^q</m>.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-lubin-tate-torsion">
      <statement>
        <p>
          With notation as in <xref ref="def-LT-extension"/>, 
          the <m>[\pi^k]</m>-torsion submodule of <m>\Lambda_f</m> is isomorphic to <m>\gotho_K/\pi^k</m>.

      <proof>

          For <m>k=1</m> we see that the <m>[\pi]</m>-torsion submodule consists of <m>q</m> elements
          (by <xref ref="rmk-LT-change-f"/> we need only check this for <m>f = \pi T + T^q</m> for which it is obvious),
          and hence is a one-dimensional <m>\gotho_K/(\pi)</m>-vector space. Since <m>[\pi]\colon \Lambda_f \to \Lambda_f</m> is surjective, 
          the general case now follows using Nakayama's lemma

    <corollary xml:id="cor-lubin-tate-totally-ramified">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The extension <m>K_\pi/K</m> is abelian and totally ramified; more precisely, there is a canonical isomorphism <m>\Gal(K_\pi/K) \to \gotho_K^\times</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The inclusion <m>\Gal(K_\pi/K) \to \gotho_K^\times</m> is immediate from <xref ref="lem-lubin-tate-torsion"/>.
          To check surjectivity and the totally ramified property, 
          we check that the torsion points of exact order <m>\pi^k</m> are the roots of an Eisenstein polynomial over <m>\gotho_K</m>.
          Again by <xref ref="rmk-LT-change-f"/> we need only check this for <m>f = \pi T + T^q</m>, in which case we can write

            [\pi]^k = \sum_{i=0}^k \pi^{k-i} T^{q^i} + \cdots

          and the omitted monomials do not contribute to the Newton polygon (each one is strictly divisible by one of the summands).
          By factoring according to the slopes of the Newton polygons (using Hensel's lemma), we see that the roots of <m>[\pi^k]</m>
          which are not roots of <m>[\pi^{k-1}]</m> are the roots of an Eisenstein polynomial over <m>\gotho_K</m>.

        For <m>K = \QQ_p</m>, we can take <m>\pi=p</m> and <m>f = (1+T)^p - 1</m>.
        In this case <m>K_\pi = \bigcup_k \QQ(\zeta_{p^k})</m> is the <m>p</m>-part of the cyclotomic tower.

          Consequently, our proposed formula for <m>\phi_K</m> has the property that <m>\phi_K(\pi)</m> fixes <m>K_\pi</m>.
          It will thus suffice to show that <m>\phi_K(\varpi)</m> fixes <m>K_{\varpi}</m> for any other uniformizer <m>\varpi</m>

      <p>
        We recall <xref ref="rmk-no-explicit-CFT"/>:
        there is no analogue of the Lubin-Tate construction over a number field,
        except when <m>K = \QQ</m> for which the multiplicative group can be used
        (recovering the Kronecker-Weber theorem) 
        or when <m>K</m> is imaginary quadratic for which an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by <m>K</m> can be used
        (see <xref ref="bib-Cox"/>).
        When <m>K</m> is a function field then there does exist such an analogue:
        for <m>K = \FF_p(t)</m> this was discovered by Carlitz,
        and this was (rediscovered and) generalized to arbitrary <m>K</m> by Drinfeld
        (see <xref ref="bib-Hayes-Drinfeld"/>).

        <p>
          Prove that in <xref ref="def-one-param-formal-group"/>, the existence of inverses is a consequence of the other conditions.

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that in <xref ref="def-one-param-formal-group"/>, if the ring <m>A</m> has characteristic 0, then commutativity is a consequence of the other conditions.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          First note that we can check commutativity after replacing <m>A</m> by <m>A</m>, so we may assume that <m>A</m> is a <m>\QQ</m>-algebra.
          In that case, show that <m>F</m> is isomorphic to the formal additive group.

        <p>
          Use an inductive argument in the manner of <xref ref="prop-formal-group-with-endomorphism"/>,
          but this time making repeated use of <xref ref="exer-sigma-linear-surj"/> to match up
          increasingly many coefficients of <m>\theta^\sigma</m> and <m>\theta \circ [a]_{f_1}</m>.
