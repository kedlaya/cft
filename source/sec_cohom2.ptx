      In the previous chapter,
      we associated to a finite group <m>G</m> and a (right) <m>G</m>-module <m>M</m> a sequence of abelian groups <m>H^i(G, M)</m>,
      called the <term>cohomology groups</term> of <m>M</m>.
      (They're also called the <term>Galois cohomology</term> groups because in number theory,
      <m>G</m> will invariably be the Galois group of some extension of number fields,
      and <m>A</m> will be some object manufactured from this extension.)
      What we didn't do is make the construction at all usable in practice!
      This time we will remedy this.

    <title>Induced <m>G</m>-modules</title>
    <p>
      In light of <xref ref="exer-acyclic-res"/>, to compute cohomology
      we are going to need an ample supply of acyclic <m>G</m>-modules.
      We will get these using a process known as <term>induction</term>.
    </p>
    <remark>
      <p>
        By way of motivation,
        we note first that if <m>G</m> is the trivial group,
        <em>every</em> <m>G</m>-module is acyclic:
        if <m>0 \to M \to I^0 \to I^1 \to \cdots</m> is an injective resolution,
        taking <m>G</m>-invariants has no effect,
        so <m>0 \to I^0 \to I^1 \to \cdots</m> is still exact except at <m>I^0</m>
        (where we omitted <m>M</m>).
      </p>
    </remark>
    <definition>
      <p>
        If <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> and <m>M</m> is an <m>H</m>-module,
        we define the <term>induction</term> of <m>M</m> from <m>H</m> to <m>G</m> to be <m>\Ind^G_H M = M \otimes_{\ZZ[H]} \ZZ[G]</m>.
        We may also identify <m>\Ind^G_H M</m> with the set of functions
        <m>\phi\colon G \to M</m> such that <m>\phi(gh) = \phi(g)^h</m> for <m>h \in H</m>,
        with the <m>G</m>-action on the latter being given by <m>\phi^g(g') = \phi(gg')</m>:
        namely, the element <m>m \otimes [g] \in M \otimes_{\ZZ[H]} \ZZ[G]</m> corresponds to the function
        <m>\phi_{m,g}</m> taking <m>g'</m> to <m>m^{gg'}</m> if <m>gg' \in H</m> and to 0 otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the opposite direction, if <m>M</m> is a <m>G</m>-module, let <m>\Res^G_H M</m> denote <m>M</m> viewed as an <m>H</m>-module
        by forgetting the rest of the group action. (We will sometimes simply write this as <m>M</m> when context makes things clear.)
      </p>
    </definition>
    <lemma xml:id="L_Shapiro">
      <title>Shapiro's lemma</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> and <m>N</m> is an <m>H</m>-module,
          then there is a canonical isomorphism <m>H^i(G, \Ind^G_H N) \to H^i(H, N)</m>.
          In particular,
          <m>N</m> is an acyclic <m>H</m>-module if and only if
          <m>\Ind^G_H(N)</m> is an acyclic <m>G</m>-module.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The key points are:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>(\Ind^G_H N)^G = N^H</m>,
                so there is an isomorphism for <m>i=0</m> (this is most visible from the description using functions);
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                the functor <m>\Ind^G_H</m> from <m>H</m>-modules to <m>G</m>-modules is exact (that is,
                <m>\ZZ[G]</m> is flat over <m>\ZZ[H]</m>; in fact it is free over <m>\ZZ[H]</m>);
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                if <m>I</m> is an injective <m>H</m>-module,
                then <m>\Ind^G_H(I)</m> is an injective <m>G</m>-module.
                This follows from the existence of a canonical isomorphism <m>\Hom_G(M, \Ind^G_H I) = \Hom_H(\Res^G_H M, I)</m>,
                for which see <xref ref="P_adjoint_property"/> below.

            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now take an injective resolution of <m>N</m>,
          apply <m>\Ind^G_H</m> to it,
          and the result is an injective resolution of <m>\Ind^G_H N</m>.

      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <definition>
      <p>
        We say <m>M</m> is an <term>induced</term> <m>G</m>-module if it has the form
        <m>\Ind^G_{1} N</m> for some abelian group <m>N</m>,
        i.e., it can be written as <m>N \otimes_\ZZ \ZZ[G]</m>.
        (The subscript 1 stands for the trivial group,
        since <m>G</m>-modules for <m>G = 1</m> are just abelian groups.)

    <corollary xml:id="C_induced_acyclic">
      <statement>

    </corollary>
    <p>
      To complete the previous argument, we need an important property of induced modules. 
      This is closely related to the <term>Frobenius reciprocity law</term> in the theory of representations of finite groups.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="P_adjoint_property">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>H</m> be a subgroup of <m>G</m>,
          let <m>M</m> be a <m>G</m>-module,
          and let <m>N</m> be an <m>H</m>-module.
          Then there are natural isomorphisms
          <md>
            <mrow>\Hom_G(M, \Ind^G_H N) \amp \cong \Hom_H(\Res^G_H M, N)</mrow>
            <mrow>\Hom_G(\Ind^G_H N, M) \amp \cong \Hom_H(N,\Res^G_H M)</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          To begin with, note that if we take <m>N = \Res^G_H M</m>,
          then the identity map between <m>\Res^G_H M</m> and <m>N</m> is supposed to correspond both to a homomorphism
          <m>\Ind^G_H \Res^G_H M \to M</m> and to a homomorphism <m>M \to \Ind^G_H \Res^G_H M</m>.
          Let us write these maps down first:
          the map <m>\Ind^G_H \Res^G_H M \to M</m> is
          <me>
            \sum_{g \in G} m_g \otimes [g] \mapsto \sum_{g \in G} (m_g)^g
          </me>,
          while the map <m>M \to \Ind^G_H \Res^G_H M</m> is
          <me>
            m \mapsto \sum_i m^{g_i} \otimes [g_i^{-1}]
          </me>
          where <m>g_i</m> runs over a set of left coset representatives of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m>.
          This second map doesn't depend on the choice of the representatives; consequently, for <m>g \in G</m>,
          we can use the coset representatives <m>gg_i</m> instead to see that
          <me>
            m^{g} \mapsto \sum_{i} m^{gg_i} \otimes [g_i^{-1}] = \left( \sum_{i} m^{gg_i} \otimes [(g g_i)^{-1}] \right)[g]
          </me>.
          This means that we do in fact get a map compatible with the <m>G</m>-actions.
          (Note that the composition of these two maps is not the identity!
          For more on this point,
          see the discussion of extended functoriality in <xref ref="sec_homology"/>.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let <m>N</m> be general.
          Given a homomorphism <m>\Res^G_H M \to N</m> of <m>H</m>-modules,
          we get a corresponding homomorphism <m>\Ind^G_H \Res^G_H M \to \Ind^G_H N</m> of <m>G</m>-modules,
          which we can then compose with the above map
          <m>M \to \Ind^G_H \Res^G_H M</m> to get a homomorphism <m>M \to \Ind^G_H N</m> of <m>G</m>-modules.
          We thus get a map
          <me>
            \Hom_H(\Res^G_H M,N) \to \Hom_G(M, \Ind^G_H N)
          </me>;
          to get the map in the other direction,
          start with a homomorphism <m>M \to \Ind^G_H N</m>,
          identify the target with functions <m>\phi\colon G \to N</m>,
          then compose with the map <m>\Res^G_H \Ind^G_H N \to N</m> taking <m>\phi</m> to <m>\phi(e)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the other direction,
          given a homomorphism <m>N \to \Res^G_H M</m> of <m>H</m>-modules,
          we get a corresponding homomorphism <m>\Ind^G_H N \to \Ind^G_H \Res^G_H M</m> of <m>G</m>-modules,
          which we can then compose with the above map
          <m>\Ind^G_H \Res^G_H M \to M</m> to get a homomorphism <m>\Ind^G_H N \to M</m> of <m>G</m>-modules.
          We thus get a map
          <me>
            \Hom_H(N,\Res^G_H M) \to \Hom_G(\Ind^G_H N,M)
          </me>;
          to get the map in the other direction,
          start with a homomorphism <m>\Ind^G_H N \to M</m> of <m>G</m>-modules and evaluate it on
          <m>n \otimes [e]</m> to get a homomorphism <m>N \to \Res^G_H M</m> of <m>H</m>-modules.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        <xref ref="P_adjoint_property"/> asserts that 
        the restriction functor <m>\Res^G_H</m> from <m>G</m>-modules to <m>H</m>-modules 
        and the induction functor <m>\Ind^G_H</m> from <m>H</m>-modules to <m>G</m>-modules form a pair of
        <term>adjoint functors</term> in both directions.
        This is rather unusual; it is far more common to have such a relationship in only one direction.
        Indeed, without assuming that <m>G</m> is finite (or at least that <m>[G:H] &lt; \infty</m>), 
        then the proof of <xref ref="P_adjoint_property"/> only shows that 
        <m>\Hom_G(\Ind^G_H N, M) \cong \Hom_H(N,M)</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark xml:id="rem-coh-finite-mod">
      <p>
        The point of all of this is that it is much easier to embed <m>M</m> into an acyclic <m>G</m>-module than into an injective <m>G</m>-module:
        use the map <m>M \to \Ind^G_1 \Res^G_H M</m> constructed in <xref ref="P_adjoint_property"/>!
        An immediate consequence is that if <m>M</m> is finite,
        it can be embedded into a finite acyclic <m>G</m>-module,
        and thus <m>H^i(G,M)</m> is finite for all <m>i</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        However, contrary to what you might expect,
        for fixed <m>M</m>, even if <m>M</m> is finite, the groups <m>H^i(G,M)</m> do not necessarily become zero for <m>i</m> large.
        We'll see explicit examples in the next section.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      Another consequence is the following result.
      (The case <m>i=1</m> was stated previously in <xref ref="ex-additive-Hilbert-90"/>.)

          The normal basis theorem
          (see Lang, <pubtitle>Algebra</pubtitle> or <xref ref="bib-Milne-CFT"/>, Lemma II.1.24)
          states that there exists <m>\alpha \in L</m> whose conjugates form a basis of <m>L</m> as a <m>K</m>-vector space.
          This implies that <m>L \cong \Ind^{G}_{1} K</m>,
          so <m>L</m> is an induced <m>G</m>-module and so is acyclic.

        To define the associated class in

        take the map <m>\rho\colon G \to M</m> characterized by <m>\rho(g)(a) = a^g</m>,
        and let <m>\phi</m> be the 1-cocycle with <m>\phi(e, g) = \rho(g)</m>.
        The verification that this defines a bijection is left to the reader.

    <example>

        The identity in <m>H^1(G,M)</m> corresponds to the trivial principal homogeneous space <m>A=M</m>,
        on which <m>G</m> acts as it does on <m>M</m> while <m>M</m> acts by translation: <m>m(a) = m+a</m>.
      </p>
      </example>
    <remark>
      <p>
        This interpretation of <m>H^1</m> appears prominently in the theory of elliptic curves.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            For example, if <m>L</m> is a finite extension of <m>K</m> and <m>E</m> is an elliptic curve over <m>K</m>,
            then <m>H^1(\Gal(L/K), E(\bar{K}))</m> is the set of <m>K</m>-isomorphism classes of curves whose Jacobians are <m>K</m>-isomorphic to <m>E</m>
            and which have an <m>L</m>-rational point but not necessarily a <m>K</m>-rational point.
            For any such curve <m>C</m>, we can define the translation map <m>E \times_K C \to C</m> by first defining it over <m>L</m>, by picking some <m>L</m>-rational point
            to use as the origin, then observing that the result is independent of the chosen point.
           </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            For another example,
            <m>H^1(\Gal(L/K), \Aut(E_{\bar{K}}))</m> parametrizes twists of <m>E</m>,
            elliptic curves defined over <m>K</m> which are <m>L</m>-isomorphic to <m>E</m>. (E.g.,
            <m>y^2 = x^3+x+1</m> versus <m>2y^2 = x^3 + x + 1</m>,
            with <m>L = \QQ(\sqrt{2})</m>.) In this example the translation action is not so obvious, and its existence depends on the fact that <m>\Aut(E_{\bar{K}})</m> is abelian.
            (One can interpret twists similarly for more general curves, for which the automorphism group need not be abelian, but then <m>H^1</m> won't make sense the way
            we have defined it; it will only have the structure of a pointed set.)

        We can also give an explicit interpretation of
        <m>H^2(G,M)</m> (see <xref ref="bib-Milne-CFT"/>, example II.1.18(b)).
        It classifies short exact sequences
        <men xml:id="eq-group-extension">
          1 \to M \to E \to G \to 1
        </men>
        of (not necessarily abelian) groups on which <m>G</m> has a fixed action on <m>M</m>.
        (Such a sequence is called an <term>extension of <m>G</m> by <m>M</m></term>, which might look backwards but there are good reasons for this convention.)
        The action is given as follows:
        given <m>g \in G</m> and <m>m \in M</m>,
        choose <m>h \in E</m> lifting <m>G</m>;
        then <m>h^{-1}mh</m> maps to the identity in <m>G</m>,
        so comes from <m>M</m>,
        and we call it <m>m^g</m> since it depends only on <m>g</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        What <q>classifies</q>
        means here is that two sequences give the same element of
        <m>H^2(G,M)</m> if and only if one can find an arrow
        <m>E \to E'</m> making the diagram in <xref ref="fig-cohom2-1"/> commute.
      </p>

        Note that two sequences may not be isomorphic under this definition even if <m>E</m> and <m>E'</m> are abstractly isomorphic as groups.
        For example,
        if <m>G = M = \ZZ/p\ZZ</m> and the action is trivial,
        then <m>H^2(G, M) = \ZZ/p\ZZ</m> even though there are only two possible groups <m>E</m>,
        namely <m>\ZZ/p^2\ZZ</m> and <m>\ZZ/p\ZZ \times \ZZ/p\ZZ</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
        The correspondence between short exact sequences and elements of <m>H^2(G,M)</m> is constructed as follows. 
        Given an exact sequence as above, 
        choose a map <m>s\colon G \to E</m> (which need not be a homomorphism) such that <m>s(g)</m> maps to <m>g</m> under the map <m>E \to G</m>.
        For any <m>a,b \in G</m>, the element <m>f(a,b) := s(ab)^{-1}s(a)s(b)</m> maps to zero in <m>G</m> and hence belongs to <m>M</m>.
        Define the function by <m>\phi\colon G^3 \to M</m> given by
        <me>
          \phi(a,b,c) = s(a)^{-1} s(ba^{-1})^{-1} s(cb^{-1})^{-1} s(ca^{-1}) s(a)
        </me>.
        It is <m>G</m>-invariant and hence a homogeneous 2-cochain: 
        if we replace <m>a,b,c</m> by <m>ag^{-1}, bg^{-1}, cg^{-1}</m> and also conjugate by <m>s(g)</m>,
        the middle three terms in the product remain fixed while <m>s(a)</m> is replaced by <m>s(ag^{-1}) s(g) = s(a) f(ag^{-1},g)</m>,
        and the factors of <m>f(ag^{-1},g)</m> and its inverse on the outside cancel because <m>M</m> is abelian.
      </p>
      <p>
        With somewhat more work, one can check that changing <m>s</m> changes <m>\phi</m> by a 2-coboundary.
        Namely, changing <m>s</m> amounts to replacing <m>s(a)</m> with <m>s(a)\psi(a)</m> for some function <m>\psi\colon G \to M</m>.
        The effect is then to change <m>\phi(a,b,c)</m> by
        <me>
          -\psi(a) - \psi(ba^{-1}) - \psi(cb^{-1})^{ba^{-1}} + \psi(ca^{-1}) + \psi(a)
        </me>
        which we recognize from <xref ref="rem-H1-as-crossed"/> as the image of a homogeneous 1-cochain under <m>d^1</m>.
        (Here we are again using the fact that <m>\psi(*)</m> commutes across any element of <m>M</m>;
        this applies to the terms that end up on the outside of the product, but <m>\psi(cb^{-1})</m> must first be commuted across
        <m>s(ba^{-1})^{-1}</m> and this is how it picks up the group action.)        
      </p>
      <p>
        In principle we should also check that <m>\phi</m> is a homogeneous 2-cocycle, but we can use a trick to avoid making the computation.
        To wit, first note that if we start with a split exact sequence of groups, then taking <m>s</m> to be a group-theoretic splitting
        yields <m>\phi(a,b,c) = 0</m>, which is certainly a cocycle. Next note that for any homomorphism <m>M \to M'</m>, the map
        <m>H^2(G,M) \to H^2(G,M')</m> corresponds to the <term>pushout</term> map shown in <xref ref="fig-cohom2-2"/>,
        in which <m>E'</m> is the coequalizer of <m>M \to E</m> and <m>M \to M'</m>.
        Finally, recall that I can always find an injective morphism <m>M \to M'</m> such that <m>H^2(G,M') = 0</m>,
        say by taking <m>M' = \Ind^G_1 M</m>; this means I can check the cocycle property after replacing <m>M</m> with <m>M'</m>,
        in which case I even have a coboundary.

    <title>Extended functoriality</title>
    <p>
      We already saw that if we have a homomorphism of <m>G</m>-modules,
      we get induced homomorphisms on cohomology groups.
      But what if we want to relate <m>G</m>-modules for different groups <m>G</m>,
      as will happen in our study of class field theory?
      It turns out that in a suitable sense,
      the cohomology groups are also functorial with respect to changing <m>G</m>.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="D-extended-functoriality">
      <p>
        Let <m>M</m> be a <m>G</m>-module and <m>M'</m> a <m>G'</m>-module.
        Suppose we are given a homomorphism
        <m>\alpha\colon G' \to G</m> of groups and a homomorphism <m>\beta\colon M \to M'</m> of abelian groups
        (note that they go in opposite directions!).
        We say these are <term>compatible</term>
        if <m>\beta(m^{\alpha(g)}) = \beta(m)^g</m> for all <m>g \in G</m> and <m>m \in M</m>.
        In this case,
        one gets canonical homomorphisms <m>H^i(G, M) \to H^i(G', M')</m>:
        one firsts constructs these on pairs of injective resolutions,
        then shows that any two choices are homotopic and hence give the same maps on cohomology.
        We will refer to the construction of such homomorphisms as the <term>extended functoriality</term> of group cohomology.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <example xml:id="exa-extended-functoriality">
      <p>
        The principal examples of extended functoriality we will be using are the following.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Note that cohomology groups inherit only the trivial <m>G</m>-action,
              because you compute them by taking invariants.
              This can be reinterpreted in terms of extended functoriality:
              let <m>\alpha\colon G \to G</m> be the conjugation by some fixed <m>h</m>:
              <m>g \mapsto h^{-1}gh</m>,
              and let <m>\beta\colon M \to M</m> be the map <m>m \mapsto m^h</m>.
              Then the induced homomorphisms
              <m>H^i(G,M) \to H^i(G,M)</m> are all identity maps.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>,
              <m>M</m> is a <m>G</m>-module,
              and <m>M'</m> is just <m>M</m> with all but the <m>H</m>-action forgotten,
              we get the <term>restriction homomorphisms</term>
              <me>
                \Res\colon H^i(G, M) \to H^i(H, \Res^G_H M)
              </me>.
              Another way to get the same map:
              use the adjunction homomorphism
              <m>M \to \Ind^G_H \Res^G_H M</m> from <xref ref="P_adjoint_property"/>
              sending <m>m</m> to <m>\sum_i m^{g_i} \otimes [g_i^{-1}]</m>,
              where <m>g_i</m> runs over a set of right coset representatives of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m>,
              then apply Shapiro's lemma (<xref ref="L_Shapiro"/>) to get
              <me>
                H^i(G, M) \to H^i(G, \Ind^G_H \Res^G_H M) \stackrel{\sim}{\to} H^i(H, \Res^G_H M)
              </me>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Let <m>M</m> be a <m>G</m>-module and consider the map
              <m>\Ind^G_H \Res^G_H M \to M</m> taking <m>m \otimes [g]</m> to <m>m^g</m>.
              We then get maps <m>H^i(G, \Ind^G_H \Res^G_H M) \to H^i(G,M)</m> which,
              together with the isomorphisms of Shapiro's lemma (<xref ref="L_Shapiro"/>),
              give what are called the <term>corestriction homomorphisms</term>:
              <me>
                \Cor\colon H^i(H, \Res^G_H M) \stackrel{\sim}{\to} H^i(G, \Ind^G_H \Res^G_H M) \to H^i(G, M)
              </me>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The composition <m>\Cor \circ \Res</m> is induced by the homomorphism of <m>G</m>-modules <m>M \to \Ind^G_H \Res^G_H M \to M</m> given by
              <me>
                m \mapsto \sum_i m^{g_i} \otimes [g_i^{-1}] \to \sum_i m = [G:H]m
              </me>.
              Thus <m>\Cor \circ \Res</m> acts as multiplication by <m>[G:H]</m> on each (co)homology group.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bonus consequence (hereafter excluding the case of <m>H^0</m>):
              if we take <m>H</m> to be the trivial group,
              then the group in the middle is isomorphic to <m>H^i(H, M) = 0</m>.
              So every cohomology group for <m>G</m> is killed by <m>\#G</m>,
              and in particular is a torsion group.
            </p>
            <p>
              In fact, if <m>M</m> is finitely generated as an abelian group,
              this means <m>H^i(G, M)</m> is always finite,
              because each of these will be finitely generated and torsion. Of course,
              this won't happen in many of our favorite examples,
              e.g., <m>H^i(\Gal(L/K), L^*)</m> for <m>L/K</m> a finite Galois extension of fields.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Let <m>H</m> be a <em>normal</em> subgroup of <m>G</m>,
              let <m>\alpha</m> be the surjection <m>G \to G/H</m>,
              and let <m>\beta</m> be the injection <m>M^H \hookrightarrow M</m>.
              Note that <m>G/H</m> acts on <m>M^H</m>;
              in this case, we get the <term>inflation homomorphisms</term>
              <me>
                \Inf\colon H^i(G/H, M^H) \to H^i(G, M)

              The inflation and restriction maps will interact in an interesting way;
