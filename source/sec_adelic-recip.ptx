  <title>The adelic reciprocity law and Artin reciprocity</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We now formulate the statements of global class field theory in adelic language, 
      imitating the setup from local class field theory but using the id&#xe8;le class group in place of the multiplicative group of the field.
      This is more than a formal similarity: it allows us to formulate a local-to-global compatibility statement that ultimately allows us to
      recover Artin reciprocity and the existence theorem (and a bit more) in the classical language.

      We are going to fix an algebraic closure <m>\overline{\QQ}</m> of <m>\QQ</m>, 
      and regard <q>number fields</q> as finite subextensions of <m>\overline{\QQ}/\QQ</m>.
      That is, we are fixing the embeddings of number fields into <m>\overline{\QQ}</m>.
      We'll use these embeddings to decide how to embed one number field in another.

    <title>The adelic reciprocity law and existence theorem</title>
    <p>
      Here are the adelic reciprocity law and existence theorem;
      notice that they look just like the local case except that the multiplicative group has been replaced by the id&#xe8;le class group.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="L_adelic_norm_is_open">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>L/K</m> an extension of number fields, <m>\Norm_{L/K} C_L</m> is an open subgroup of <m>C_K</m> of finite index.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>S</m> be any finite set of places of <m>K</m> containing all infinite places and all places that ramify in <m>L</m>.
          Let <m>T</m> be the set of places of <m>L</m> lying above places in <m>S</m>. 
          We first compute that
          <me>
            \Norm_{L/K} I_{L,S} = \prod_{v \in S} U_v \times \prod_{v \notin S} \gotho_{K_v}^*
          </me>
          for some open subgroups <m>U_v</m> of <m>K_v^*</m> of finite index;
          this amounts to a separate computation for each <m>v</m>.
          For <m>v \in S</m> finite, we apply <xref ref="T_local_existence"/> (or <xref ref="exer-norm-subgroup-is-open"/>).
          For <m>v \in S</m> infinite, we note that <m>\Norm\colon \CC^* \to \RR^*</m> has image <m>\RR^+</m> of index <m>2</m>.
          For <m>v \notin S</m>, we apply <xref ref="P_unramified_norm_surjective"/>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking the union over <m>S</m>, we see that <m>\Norm_{L/K} I_L</m> is an open subgroup of <m>I_K</m>.
          By quotienting down to <m>C_K</m>, we see that <m>\Norm_{L/K} C_L</m> is open;
          in fact, the snake lemma on the diagram <xref ref="fig-ideles-cohom1-1"/>
          implies that the quotient <m>I_K/(K^* \times \Norm_{L/K} I_L)</m> is isomorphic to <m>C_K/\Norm_{L/K} C_L</m>.
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="fig-ideles-cohom1-1">
          <image>
            <latex-image>
              \xymatrix{
                0 \ar[r] &amp; L^* \ar[r] \ar^{\Norm_{L/K}}[d] &amp; I_L \ar[r] \ar^{\Norm_{L/K}}[d] &amp; C_L \ar[r] \ar^{\Norm_{L/K}}[d] &amp; 0 \\
                0 \ar[r] &amp; K^* \ar[r] &amp; I_K \ar[r] &amp; C_K \ar[r] &amp; 0
              }
            </latex-image>
          </image>
        </figure>
        <p>
          We still need to check that the index <m>[C_K:\Norm_{L/K} C_L]</m> is finite. For this, we note that the inclusion <m>C_K^0 \to C_K</m> induces a homeomorphism
          <me>
            C_K^0/\Norm_{L/K} C_L^0 \cong C_K / \Norm_{L/K} C_L
          </me>
          of topological groups. Consequently, this group is both discrete (by the previous paragraph) 
          and compact (by <xref ref="P_idele_group_compact"/>), hence finite.
        </p>
      </proof>

      We will also obtain a global analogue of the local norm limitation theorem, which was not even suggested by the classical language.
      (Well, not in this treatment anyway. See <xref ref="lem-norm-quotient-classical"/> for an interpretation of the quotient <m>C_K/\Norm_{L/K} C_L</m>

    <title>More on the reciprocity map</title>
    <p>
      The statement of <xref ref="T_adelic_reciprocity_law"/> does not give any direct information about the map <m>r_K</m>.
      We describe this map more explicitly using local class field theory and the principle of <term>local-global compatibility</term>.
      We note in passing that this principle also lies at the heart of the extension of class field theory envisioned in the 
      Langlands program (<xref ref="rmk-beyond-CFT"/>).
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-adelic-reciprocity-candidate">
      <p>
        Let <m>L/K</m> be an abelian extension of number fields and <m>v</m> a place of <m>K</m>.
        Put <m>G := \Gal(L/K)</m> and let <m>G_v</m> be the <term>decomposition group</term> of <m>v</m>, that is,
        the set of <m>g \in G</m> such that <m>v^g = v</m>.
        Then for any place <m>w</m> above <m>v</m>, <m>G_v \cong \Gal(L_w/K_v)</m>.
        We will define a map <m>r_{K, v}\colon K_v^* \to G_v \subseteq G</m> as follows.
        <ul>
          <li>
            If <m>v</m> is a finite place, use the local reciprocity map (<xref ref="T_local_reciprocity"/>).
          </li>
          <li>
            If <m>v</m> is a real place, use the sign map <m>\RR^* \to \{\pm 1\} \cong G_v</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            If <m>v</m> is a complex place, then <m>G_v</m> is trivial and so there is nothing left to specify.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        We obtain a well-defined product map
        <me>
          \tilde{r}_K\colon I_K \to G, \qquad (\alpha_v) \mapsto \prod_v r_{K,v}(\alpha_v)
        </me>
        by arguing as follows.
        For <m>(\alpha_v) \in I_K</m>,
        <m>\alpha_v</m> is a unit for almost all <m>v</m> and <m>L_w/K_v</m> is unramified for almost all <m>v</m> (we may ignore infinite places here).
        For the (almost all) <m>v</m> in both categories, <m>r_{K,v}</m> maps <m>\alpha_v</m> to the identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since each of the maps <m>r_{K,v}</m> is continuous, so is the map <m>\tilde{r}_K</m>.
        That means the kernel of <m>\tilde{r}_K\colon I_K \to \Gal(L/K)</m> is an open subgroup of <m>I_K</m>.

      Here is the subtle point, and the real source of <q>reciprocity</q> in this construction.

          For <m>L/K</m> an abelian extension of number fields, the map <m>\tilde{r}_K\colon I_K \to \Gal(L/K)</m> is trivial on <m>K^*</m>;

    <remark xml:id="rmk-cyclotomic-Artin">
      <p>
        In case <m>L = K(\zeta_n)</m> for some <m>n</m>, we can verify the first assertion of <xref ref="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal"/> by an explicit computation,
        similar to the direct verification of Artin reciprocity for these extensions; this will play a key role in both approaches to adelic reciprocity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us spell this out explicitly for <m>K = \QQ, L = K(\zeta_{p^m})</m>, where we have a concrete identification <m>\Gal(L/K) \cong (\ZZ/p^m\ZZ)^*</m>.
        In this case, we are claiming that for any place <m>\ell</m> of <m>\QQ</m> and any <m>a \in \QQ^*</m>,
        <me>
          r_{\QQ_{\ell}(\zeta_{p^m})/\QQ_{\ell}}(a) = \begin{cases}\sign(a) \amp  \ell = \infty \\ \ell^{v_{\ell}(a)} \amp  \ell \neq \infty, p \\ p^{v_p(a)} a^{-1} \amp  \ell = p. \end{cases}
        </me>
        This is clear when <m>\ell = \infty</m>. For <m>\ell</m> finite and distinct from <m>p</m>, we are in an unramified situation,
        where the effect of local reciprocity is to take any uniformizer (i.e., <m>\ell</m>) to the local Frobenius at <m>\ell</m> (i.e., the automorphism <m>\zeta_n \mapsto \zeta_n^\ell</m>).
        The interesting case is when <m>\ell = p</m>, for which we consult <xref ref="exa-local-recip-Qp"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fom the previous paragraph, we directly obtain the first assertion of <xref ref="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal"/> for <m>K = \QQ, L = K(\zeta_n)</m>.
        The case where <m>K</m> is general and <m>L = K(\zeta_n)</m> then follows from <xref ref="prop-norm-compatibility-of-local-reciprocity"/>.

    <title>Back to classical reciprocity</title>
    <p>
      We now apply adelic reciprocity and local-global compatibility to recover the ideal-theoretic formulations of Artin reciprocity and the existence theorem.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-deduce-Artin">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L/K</m> be an abelian extension of number fields.
          Given <xref ref="T_adelic_reciprocity_law"/> and <xref ref="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal"/>,
          let <m>U</m> be the kernel of <m>r_K</m> and
          identify <m>C_K/U</m> with a generalized ideal class group (<xref ref="rmk-open-subgroup-idele"/>) of some conductor <m>\gothm</m>.
          Then the map <m>C_K/U \to \Gal(L/K)</m> is the Artin map; consequently, <xref ref="T-Artin-reciprocity"/> holds.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The id&#xe8;le <m>\alpha = (1,1, \dots, \pi, \dots)</m> with a uniformizer <m>\pi</m> of
          <m>\gotho_{K_\gothp}</m> in the <m>\gothp</m> component and <m>1</m> elsewhere maps onto the class of <m>\gothp</m> in <m>C_K/U</m>.
          On the other hand, <m>r_K(\alpha) = r_{K, \gothp}(\pi)</m> is precisely the Frobenius of <m>\gothp</m>
          (because <m>L</m> is unramified over <m>K</m>).
          So indeed <m>\gothp</m> is being mapped to its Frobenius, and the map <m>C_K/U \to \Gal(L/K)</m> is indeed Artin reciprocity.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <remark xml:id="rem-classical-existence-theorem">
      <p>
        We may use similar logic to recover the ideal-theoretic formulation of the existence theorem (<xref ref="T-existence-theorem"/>):
        each generalized ideal class group arises as a quotient of <m>C_K</m> by an open subgroup (see again <xref ref="rmk-open-subgroup-idele"/>,
        and also <xref ref="def-second-inequality-analytic"/>)
        and so <xref ref="T_adelic_existence_theorem1"/> produces the desired abelian extension.
      </p>
      <p>
        The argument from <xref ref="prop-deduce-Artin"/> also gives some additional information about the Artin map.
        First, the Artin map factors through a generalized ideal class group
        whose conductor <m>\gothm</m> is divisible <em>precisely</em> by the ramified primes.
        Second, we can <em>exactly</em> describe the kernel of the classical Artin map: it is generated by
        <ul>
          <li>
            all principal ideals congruent to 1 modulo <m>\gothm</m>;
          </li>
          <li>
            norms of ideals of <m>L</m> not divisible by any ramified primes.
