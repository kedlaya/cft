  <title>The adelic reciprocity law and Artin reciprocity</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We now describe the setup by which we create a reciprocity law in global class field theory,
      imitating the <q>abstract</q>
      setup from local class field theory but using the id&#xe8;le class group in place of the multiplicative group of the field.
      We then work out why the reciprocity law and existence theorem in the adelic setup imply Artin reciprocity and the existence theorem
      (and a bit more)
      in the classical language.

      We are going to fix an algebraic closure <m>\overline{\QQ}</m> of <m>\QQ</m>, 
      and regard <q>number fields</q> as finite subextensions of <m>\overline{\QQ}/\QQ</m>.
      That is, we are fixing the embeddings of number fields into <m>\overline{\QQ}</m>.
      We'll use these embeddings to decide how to embed one number field in another.

    <title>The adelic reciprocity law and existence theorem</title>
    <p>
      Here are the adelic reciprocity law and existence theorem;
      notice that they look just like the local case except that the multiplicative group has been replaced by the id&#xe8;le class group.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="L_adelic_norm_is_open">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>L/K</m> an extension of number fields, <m>\Norm_{L/K} C_L</m> is an open subgroup of <m>C_K</m> of finite index.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>S</m> be any finite set of places of <m>K</m> containing all infinite places and all places that ramify in <m>L</m>.
          Let <m>T</m> be the set of places of <m>L</m> lying above places in <m>S</m>. 
          We first compute that
          <me>
            \Norm_{L/K} I_{L,S} = \prod_{v \in S} U_v \times \prod_{v \notin S} \gotho_{K_v}^*
          </me>;
          this amounts to a separate computation for each <m>v</m>.
          For <m>v \in S</m> finite, we apply <xref ref="T_local_existence"/> (or <xref ref="exer-norm-subgroup-is-open"/>).
          For <m>v \in S</m> finite, we note that <m>\Norm\colon \CC^* \to \RR^*</m> has image <m>\RR^+</m> of index <m>2</m>.
          For <m>v \notin S</m>, we apply <xref ref="P_unramified_norm_surjective"/>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking the union over <m>S</m>, we see that <m>\Norm_{L/K} I_L</m> is an open subgroup of <m>I_K</m> of finite index.
          By quotienting down to <m>C_K</m>, we see that <m>\Norm_{L/K} C_K</m> is open;
          in fact, the snake lemma on the diagram <xref ref="fig-ideles-cohom1-1"/>
          implies that the quotient <m>I_K/(K^* \times \Norm_{L/K} I_L)</m> is isomorphic to <m>C_K/\Norm_{L/K} C_L</m>.
        </p>

    <theorem xml:id="T_adelic_reciprocity_law">
      <title>Adelic reciprocity law</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For each number field <m>K</m>,
          there is a canonical map <m>r_K\colon C_K \to \Gal(K^{\ab}/K)</m> which induces,
          for each Galois extension <m>L/K</m> of number fields,
          an isomorphism <m>r_{L/K}\colon C_K/\Norm_{L/K} C_L \to \Gal(L/K)^{\ab}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We will first prove an <q>abstract</q> form of this theorem, in which we do not say much about the identity of the map <m>r_K</m>;
          see <xref ref="T_abstract_adelic_reciprocity"/>. We then prove a more precise version including a more specific recipe for the map; see <xref ref="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal"/> for the
          recipe and <xref ref="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal2"/> for the comparison with the abstract version.
          See also <xref ref="sec_adelic-overview"/> for a more detailed summary of the argument.

    <theorem xml:id="T_adelic_existence_theorem1">
      <title>Adelic existence theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For every number field <m>K</m> and every open subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>C_K</m> of finite index,
          there exists a finite (abelian) extension <m>L</m> of <m>K</m> such that <m>H = \Norm_{L/K} C_L</m>.

          See <xref ref="T_adelic_existence_theorem2"/>.

      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      We will also obtain a global analogue of the local norm limitation theorem, which was not even suggested by the classical language.
      (Well, not in this treatment anyway. See <xref ref="lem-norm-quotient-classical"/> for an interpretation of the quotient <m>C_K/\Norm_{L/K} C_L</m>
      in ideal-theoretic terms.)

    <theorem xml:id="T_adelic_norm_limitation1">
      <title>Adelic norm limitation theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L/K</m> be a (not necessarily Galois) extension of number fields and put <m>M = L \cap K^{\ab}</m>.
          Then <m>\Norm_{L/K} C_L = \Norm_{M/K} C_M</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          As in the local setting, this follows directly from <xref ref="T_adelic_reciprocity_law"/>
          by the logic of <xref ref="rem-deduce-local-norm-limitation"/>.

    <title>More on the reciprocity map</title>
    <p>
      We next use local class field theory and the principle of <term>local-global compatibility</term> to come up with a candidate for the map <m>r_K</m> in 
      the adelic reciprocity law (<xref ref="T_adelic_reciprocity_law"/>). 
      We note in passing that this principle also lies at the heart of the extension of class field theory envisioned in the 
      Langlands program (<xref ref="rmk-beyond-CFT"/>).
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-adelic-reciprocity-candidate">
      <p>
        Let <m>L/K</m> be an abelian extension of number fields and <m>v</m> a place of <m>K</m>.
        Put <m>G = \Gal(L/K)</m> and let <m>G_v</m> be the <term>decomposition group</term> of <m>v</m>, that is,
        the set of <m>g \in G</m> such that <m>v^g = v</m>.
        Then for any place <m>w</m> above <m>v</m>,
        <m>G_v \cong \Gal(L_w/K_v)</m>.
        We will define a map <m>r_{K, v}\colon K_v^* \to G_v \subseteq G</m> as follows.
        <ul>
          <li>
            If <m>v</m> is a finite place, use the local reciprocity map (<xref ref="T_local_reciprocity"/>).
          </li>
          <li>
            If <m>v</m> is a real place, use the sign map <m>\RR^* \to \{\pm 1\} \cong G_v</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            If <m>v</m> is a complex place, then <m>G_v</m> is trivial and so there is nothing left to specify.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        We obtain a well-defined product map
        <me>
          \tilde{r}_K\colon I_K \to G, \qquad (\alpha_v) \mapsto \prod_v r_{K,v}(\alpha_v)
        </me>
        by arguing as follows.
        For <m>(\alpha_v) \in I_K</m>,
        <m>\alpha_v</m> is a unit for almost all <m>v</m> and <m>L_w/K_v</m> is unramified for almost all <m>v</m> (we may ignore infinite places here).
        For the (almost all) <m>v</m> in both categories,
        <m>r_{K,v}</m> maps <m>\alpha_v</m> to the identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since each of the maps <m>r_{K,v}</m> is continuous, so is the map <m>\tilde{r}_K</m>.
        That means the kernel of <m>\tilde{r}_K\colon I_K \to \Gal(L/K)</m> is an open subgroup of <m>I_K</m>.
      </p>

    <p>
      Here is the subtle point, and the real source of <q>reciprocity</q> in this construction.

    <proposition xml:id="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>L/K</m> an abelian extension of number fields, the map <m>\tilde{r}_K\colon I_K \to \Gal(L/K)</m> is trivial on <m>K^*</m>
          and the induced map <m>r_K\colon C_K \to \Gal(L/K)</m> coincides with the one induced by the abstract reciprocity map (<xref ref="T_adelic_reciprocity_law"/>).
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          See <xref ref="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal2"/>.
          Alternatively, see <xref ref="rmk-local-global-via-brauer"/> for a treatment of the first assertion that does not go through abstract class field theory.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-cyclotomic-Artin">
      <p>
        In case <m>L = K(\zeta_n)</m> for some <m>n</m>, we can verify the first assertion of <xref ref="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal"/> by an explicit computation,
        similar to the direct verification of Artin reciprocity for these extensions. This suggests that in general, we must first prove the adelic existence
        theorem (<xref ref="T_adelic_existence_theorem1"/>) before establishing <xref ref="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal"/>. In the interim, we will derive
        a makeshift form of adelic reciprocity from the framework of abstract class field theory.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-deduce-Artin">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L/K</m> be an abelian extension of number fields.
          Given <xref ref="T_adelic_reciprocity_law"/> and <xref ref="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal"/>,
          let <m>U</m> be the kernel of <m>r_K</m>,
          identify <m>C_K/U</m> with a generalized ideal class group (<xref ref="rmk-open-subgroup-idele"/>) of some conductor <m>\gothm</m>.
          Then the map <m>C_K/U \to \Gal(L/K)</m> is the Artin map; consequently, <xref ref="T-Artin-reciprocity"/> holds.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The id&#xe8;le <m>\alpha = (1,1, \dots, \pi, \dots)</m> with a uniformizer <m>\pi</m> of
          <m>\gotho_{K_\gothp}</m> in the <m>\gothp</m> component and 1s elsewhere maps onto the class of <m>\gothp</m> in <m>C_K/U</m>.
          On the other hand, <m>r_K(\alpha) = r_{K, \gothp}(\pi)</m> is
          (because <m>L</m> is unramified over <m>K</m>)
          precisely the Frobenius of <m>\gothp</m>.
          So indeed, <m>\gothp</m> is being mapped to its Frobenius,
          so the map <m>C_K/U \to \Gal(L/K)</m> is indeed Artin reciprocity.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        The argument from <xref ref="prop-deduce-Artin"/> also gives some additional information about the Artin map.
        First, the Artin map factors through a generalized ideal class group
        whose conductor <m>\gothm</m> is divisible <em>precisely</em> by the ramified primes.
        Second, we can <em>exactly</em> describe the kernel of the classical Artin map: it is generated by
        <ul>
          <li>
              all principal ideals congruent to 1 modulo <m>\gothm</m>;
          </li>
          <li>
              norms of ideals of <m>L</m> not divisible by any ramified primes.
          </li>
        </ul>
