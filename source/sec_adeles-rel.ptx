        Up to now, we have considered the ring of ad&#xe8;les associated to a single number field.
        We now turn to the effect of a field extension on this construction.

  <subsection>
    <title>Ad&#xe8;les in field extensions</title>
    <definition>
      <p>
        If <m>L/K</m> is an extension of number fields,
        we get an embedding <m>\AA_K \hookrightarrow \AA_L</m> as follows:
        given <m>\alpha \in \AA_K</m>,
        each place <m>w</m> of <m>L</m> restricts to a place <m>v</m> of <m>K</m>,
        so it makes sense to declare that the <m>w</m>-component of the image of <m>\alpha</m> shall equal <m>\alpha_v</m>.
        This embedding induces an inclusion <m>I_K \hookrightarrow I_L</m> of id&#xe8;le groups.
        These embeddings are compatible with the topologies in both cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        All automorphisms of <m>L/K</m> act naturally (and continuously) on <m>\AA_L</m> and <m>I_L</m>.
        More generally, if <m>g \in \Gal(\overline{K}/K)</m>,
        then <m>g</m> maps <m>L</m> to some other extension <m>L^g</m> of <m>K</m>,
        and <m>g</m> induces isomorphisms 
        <me>
          \AA_L \cong \AA_{L^g}, \qquad I_L \cong I_{L^g}, \qquad C_L \cong C_{L^g}
        </me>.
        Explicitly, if <m>(\alpha_w)_w \in \AA_L</m> and <m>g \in G</m>,
        then <m>g</m> maps the completion <m>L_w</m> of <m>L</m> to a completion <m>L_{w^g}</m> of <m>L^g</m>.
        (Remember that a place <m>w</m> of <m>L</m> corresponds to an absolute value <m>|\cdot|_w</m> on <m>L</m>;
        the absolute value <m>|\cdot|_{w^g}</m> on <m>L^g</m> is given by <m>|a^g|_{w^g} = |a|_w</m>.
        Compare <xref ref="def-Minkowski-lattice"/> which was a special case of this.)
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        A more conceptual interpretation of the previous discussion is to identify <m>\AA_L</m> with the tensor product <m>\AA_K \otimes_K L</m>.
        In particular, this is a good way to see the Galois action on <m>\AA_L</m>. See <xref ref="exer-adeles-tensor-product"/>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark xml:id="rem-too-many-automs">
      <p>
        When <m>K</m> is totally real, it is possible to show that every automorphism of <m>\AA_K</m> is induced by an automorphism of <m>K</m> over <m>\QQ</m>, even if we ignore topology and consider
        automorphisms of the underlying ring which need not be continuous. See <xref ref="exer-automorphisms-AK"/>.
        This breaks down when <m>K</m> has complex places because <m>\CC</m> has many automorphisms as a field without topology: the automorphism group
        acts transitively on <m>\CC \setminus \overline{\QQ}</m>.
      </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Trace and norm</title>
    <definition>
      <p>
        For <m>L/K</m> an extension of number fields, we define the <term>trace map</term> <m>\Trace_{L/K}\colon \AA_L \to \AA_K</m>
        and the <term>norm map</term> <m>\Norm_{L/K}\colon I_L \to I_K</m> by the formulas
        <me>
          \Trace_{L/K}(x) = \sum_g x^g, \qquad \Norm_{L/K}(x) = \prod_g x^g
        </me>
        where <m>g</m> runs over coset representatives of
        <m>\Gal(\overline{K}/L)</m> in <m>\Gal(\overline{K}/K)</m>.
        Here the sum and product take place in the ad&#xe8;le and id&#xe8;le rings of the Galois closure of <m>L</m> over <m>K</m>;
        in particular, if <m>L/K</m> is Galois, <m>g</m> simply runs over <m>\Gal(L/K)</m> and the arithmetic takes place in <m>\AA_L</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of components, these definitions translate as
        <md>
          <mrow>(\Trace_{L/K}(\alpha))_{v} \amp = \sum_{w | v} \Trace_{L_w/K_v}(\alpha_w)</mrow>
          <mrow>(\Norm_{L/K}(\alpha))_{v} \amp = \prod_{w | v} \Norm_{L_w/K_v}(\alpha_w)</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The trace and norm as defined here are compatible with the usual definitions for principal ad&#xe8;les/id&#xe8;les.
        In particular, the norm induces a map <m>\Norm_{L/K}\colon C_L \to C_K</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        You can also define the trace of an ad&#xe8;le
        <m>\alpha \in \AA_L</m> as the trace of addition by <m>\alpha</m> as an endomorphism of the finite free <m>\AA_K</m>-module <m>\AA_L</m>,
        and the norm of an id&#xe8;le
        <m>\alpha \in I_L</m> as the determinant of multiplication by <m>\alpha</m> as an automorphism of the finite free <m>\AA_K</m>-module <m>\AA_L</m>.
        (Yes, the action is on the <em>ad&#xe8;les</em> in both cases.
        Remember from <xref ref="rmk-idele-topology"/> that id&#xe8;les should be thought of as automorphisms of the ad&#xe8;les,
        not as elements of the ad&#xe8;le ring, in order to topologize them correctly.)

    <title>Id&#xe8;le groups and class groups</title>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-adeles-Galois-invars">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>L/K</m> is a Galois extension with Galois group <m>G</m>,
          then <m>\AA_L^G = \AA_K</m> and <m>I_L^G = I_K</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        If <m>v</m> is a place of <m>K</m>,
        then for each place <m>w</m> of <m>K</m> above <m>v</m>,
        the decomposition group <m>G_w</m> of <m>w</m> is isomorphic to <m>\Gal(L_w/K_v)</m>.
        So if <m>(\alpha)</m> is an ad&#xe8;le or id&#xe8;le which is <m>G</m>-invariant,
        then <m>\alpha_w</m> is <m>\Gal(L_w/K_v)</m>-invariant for each <m>w</m>,
        so belongs to <m>K_v</m>.
        Moreover, <m>G</m> acts transitively on the places <m>w</m> above <m>v</m>,
        so <m>\alpha_w = \alpha_{w'}</m> for any two places <m>w, w'</m> above <m>v</m>.
        Thus <m>(\alpha)</m> is an ad&#xe8;le or id&#xe8;le over <m>K</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      This has the following consequence for id&#xe8;le class groups. Note that for <m>L/K</m> any extension of number fields,
      we can see that <m>C_K \to C_L</m> is injective from the fact that <m>L^* \cap I_K = K^*</m> within <m>I_L</m>,
      which follows from the fact that <m>L \cap \AA_K = K</m> within <m>\AA_L</m>
      (e.g., by <xref ref="exer-integral-closure-adelic"/>).
    </p>
    <corollary xml:id="cor-idele-group-galois-descent">
      <title>Galois descent</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>L/K</m> is a Galois extension with Galois group <m>G</m>, then <m>G</m> acts on <m>C_L</m>,
          and the <m>G</m>-invariant elements are precisely <m>C_K</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We start with an exact sequence
          <me>
            1 \to L^* \to I_L \to C_L \to 1
          </me>
          of <m>G</m>-modules.
          Taking <m>G</m>-invariants, we get a long exact sequence
          <me>
            1 \to (L^*)^G = K^* \to (I_L)^G = I_K \to C_L^G \to H^1(G, L^*)
          </me>,
          and the last term is 1 by Theorem 90 (<xref ref="L_theorem_90"/>).
          So we again have a short exact sequence, and <m>C_L^G \cong I_K/K^* = C_K</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </corollary>
    <remark>
      <p>
        There is no analogue of <xref ref="cor-idele-group-galois-descent"/> for ideal class groups:
        the map <m>\Cl(K) \to \Cl(L)^G</m> is neither injective nor surjective in general (<xref ref="exer-map-of-class-groups"/>).
        This is our first hint of why the id&#xe8;le class group will be a more convenient target for a reciprocity map than the ideal class group.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group <m>\Cl(L)^G</m> is classically known as the group of <term>ambiguous classes</term> of <m>L/K</m>.
        This is related to the concept of a <term>P&#xf3;lya field</term> from <xref ref="rmk-Polya-field"/>; see <xref ref="bib-Chabert"/>.
