  <title>Cohomology of groups</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this chapter, we introduce the cohomology of finite groups, which plays a key role in the proofs of class field theory.
      We also discuss homology and Tate groups, and touch briefly on profinite groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      We begin with the construction of group cohomology in the language of derived functors.
      Readers not familiar with this material may find it easiest to treat <xref ref="sec_cohom1"/> as a <q>black box</q> on first reading.
