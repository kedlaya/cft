  <p>
    Class field theory is a vast expanse of mathematics,
    so it's worth concluding by taking stock of what we've seen and what we haven't.
    First, a reminder of the main topics we have covered.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The Kronecker-Weber theorem:
          the maximal abelian extension of <m>\QQ</m> is generated by roots of unity.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Computations of group cohomology in the local

      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, some things that we haven't covered.
    When this course was first taught,
    these topics were assigned as final projects to individual students in the course.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The Lubin-Tate construction of explicit class field theory for local fields.

          The Brauer group of a field (i.e., <m>H^2(\Gal(\overline{K}/K), K^*)</m>),
          its relationship with central simple algebras,
          and the Fundamental Exact Sequence.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          More details about zeta functions and L-functions,

        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          An analogue of the Kronecker-Weber theorem over the function field <m>\FF_q(t)</m>,
          and even over its extensions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Explicit class field theory for imaginary quadratic fields,
          via elliptic curves with complex multiplication.

        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Some additional topics for further reading would include the following.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The Golod-Shafarevich inequality and the class field tower problem
          (see Cassels-Fr&#xf6;hlich).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Class field theory for function fields used to produce curves over finite fields with unusually many points
          (see the web site <url xref="http://manypoints.org">manypoints.org</url> for references).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Application of Artin reciprocity to cubic,
          quartic, and higher reciprocity
          (see Milne).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Algorithmic class field theory
          (see the books of Henri Cohen).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    And finally,
    some ruminations about where number theory has gone in the fifty or so years since the results of class field theory were established in the form that we saw them.
    In its cleanest form,
    class field theory describes a correspondence between one-dimensional representations of <m>\Gal(\overline{K}/K)</m>,
    for <m>K</m> a number field,
    and certain representations of <m>\GL_1(\AA_K)</m>,
    otherwise known as the group of id&#xe8;les.
    But what about the nonabelian extensions of <m>K</m>,
    or what is about the same,
    the higher-dimensional representations of <m>\Gal(\overline{K}/K)</m>?
  </p>
  <p>
    In fact, building on work of many authors, Langlands has proposed that for every <m>n</m>,
    there should be a correspondence between <m>n</m>-dimensional representations of
    <m>\Gal(\overline{K}/K)</m> and representations of <m>\GL_n(\AA_K)</m>.
    This correspondence is the heart of the so-called
    <q>Langlands Program</q>, an unbelievably deep web of statements which has driven much of the mathematical establishment for the last few decades.
    For example, for <m>n=2</m>,
    this correspondence includes on one hand the <m>2</m>-dimensional Galois representations coming from elliptic curves,
    and on the other hand representations of
    <m>\GL_2(\AA_K)</m> corresponding to modular forms.
    In particular, it includes the
    <q>modularity of elliptic curves</q>, proved by Breuil, Conrad, Diamond, and Taylor following on the celebrated work of Wiles and Taylor-Wiles on Fermat's Last Theorem.
  </p>
  <p>
    Various analogues of the Langlands correspondence have been worked out very recently:
    for local fields by Taylor and Harris
    (and again, more simply, by Henniart and Scholze),
    and for function fields by Lafforgue,
    based on the work of Drinfeld.
    The work of Laumon and Ngo on the Langlands fundamental lemma is also part of this story.
  </p>

    Okay, enough rambling for now; I hope that helps provide a bit of perspective.
    Thanks for reading!
