    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    And finally, some ruminations about where number theory has gone since the mid-20th century, expanding upon <xref ref="rmk-beyond-CFT"/>.
    In its cleanest form, class field theory describes a correspondence between one-dimensional representations of <m>\Gal(\overline{K}/K)</m>,
    for <m>K</m> a number field,
    and certain representations of <m>\GL_1(\AA_K)</m>,
    otherwise known as the group of id&#xe8;les.
    But what about the nonabelian extensions of <m>K</m>, or equivalently the higher-dimensional representations of <m>\Gal(\overline{K}/K)</m>?
  </p>
  <p>
    Building on work of many authors, Langlands has proposed that for every <m>n</m>,
    there should be a correspondence between <m>n</m>-dimensional representations of
    <m>\Gal(\overline{K}/K)</m> and representations of <m>\GL_n(\AA_K)</m>.
    This correspondence is the heart of the so-called
    <term>Langlands Program</term>, an unbelievably deep web of statements which has driven much of the mathematical establishment for the last few decades.
    For example, for <m>n=2</m>,
    this correspondence includes on one hand the <m>2</m>-dimensional Galois representations coming from elliptic curves,
    and on the other hand representations of
    <m>\GL_2(\AA_K)</m> corresponding to modular forms (see <xref ref="bib-Gelbart"/> for the reinterpretation of the classical theory of modular forms in this language).
    In particular, it includes the
    <term>modularity of elliptic curves</term>, proved by Breuil, Conrad, Diamond, and Taylor <xref ref="bib-BCDT"/>
    following on the celebrated work of Wiles <xref ref="bib-Wiles"/> and Taylor-Wiles <xref ref="bib-Taylor-Wiles"/> on Fermat's Last Theorem.
  </p>
  <p>
    Various analogues of the Langlands correspondence have been worked out:
    for local fields by Harris and Taylor <xref ref="bib-Harris-Taylor"/>,
    with subsequent simplifications by Henniart <xref ref="bib-Henniart"/> and Scholze <xref ref="bib-Scholze"/>;
    and for function fields by L. Lafforgue <xref ref="bib-Lafforgue_L"/>, building on the case <m>n=2</m> which was treated by Drinfeld.
    Moreover, one can pin things down better by replacing <m>\GL_n</m> with a more general algebraic group;
    in the function fields, this case is addressed by V. Lafforgue <xref ref="bib-Lafforgue-V"/>.
    The work of Waldspurger <xref ref="bib-Waldspurger"/> of Laumon and Ng&#xf4; <xref ref="bib-Laumon-Ngo"/> on the Langlands fundamental lemma is also part of this story.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recently, some intriguing links have emerged between the Langlands program and some duality theories appearing in mathematical physics,
    leading to fruitful transfers of ideas in both directions. See <xref ref="bib-Kapustin-Witten"/> for the starting point.

    This discussion could be continued almost indefinitely, so I have made the arbitrary decision to stop here.
    Thanks for reading!
