      We discuss Brauer groups of fields, especially number fields. On one hand these can be used to give an alternate construction of the global reciprocity map,
      not based on abstract class field theory; on the other hand, they carry important information from class field theory which is useful in numerous
      applications.

  <subsection>
    <title>The Brauer group of a field</title>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Recall from <xref ref="def-Brauer-group"/> that we have defined the <term>Brauer group</term> of a field <m>K</m> as the group 
        <me>
          \Br(K) = H^2(\Gal(\overline{K}/K), \overline{K}^*) = \varinjlim_{L/K} H^2(\Gal(L/K), L^*)
        </me>
        where <m>L</m> runs over finite Galois extensions of <m>K</m> and the transition maps in the direct limit are inflation maps.
        By <xref ref="L_theorem_90"/> and <xref ref="P_inflation_restriction"/>, these maps are all injective, so the direct limit is actually a union..
      </p>
    </definition>
    <p>
      This definition of Brauer groups is not the original one; we give that next.
    </p>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any field <m>K</m>, there is a natural bijection between <m>\Br(K)</m> and the isomorphism classes of division algebras with center <m>K</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          See <xref ref="bib-Milne-CFT"/>, Corollary IV.3.16 or <xref ref="bib-Serre-LocalFields"/>, Chapter X, Proposition 9.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <example>
      <p>
        For <m>K</m> a finite field, <m>\Br(K)</m> is trivial. In the classical interpretation, this is Wedderburn's theorem that every finite division algebra
        is commutative. In the cohomological interpretation, it follows from <xref ref="P_finite_norm_surjective"/> via the periodicity of Tate groups
        <xref ref="T_cyclic_group_periodicity"/>.
      </p>
    </example>
    <remark>
      <p>
        One can also associate Brauer groups to arbitrary rings and even to schemes in algebraic geometry, by replacing division algebras (or more precisely,
        central simple algebras) with <term>Azumaya algebras</term> and Galois cohomology with <term>&#xe9;tale cohomology</term>.

  <subsection>
    <title>Local-global compatibility via Brauer groups</title>
    <p>
      Recall that in the cohomological approach to local class field theory, the crucial computation was that of the Brauer groups of local fields,
      which involved first studying unramified extensions and then transferring the knowledge to general extensions (see the proof of <xref ref="P_H2_lower_bound"/>).
      We can use a similar approach
      to recover local-global compatibility in global class field theory, using Brauer groups to transfer the fact that the reciprocity maps defined out of local
      factors are trivial on prinicipal id&#xe8;les from the cyclotomic case to the general case. Since this is not logically necessary for our treatment,
      we will take leave to skip a few details that do not fit neatly into our narrative.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-diagonal-cyclotomic">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>K</m> be a number field and put <m>L = K(\zeta_n)</m>.
          Then <m>r_{L/K}: I_K \to \Gal(L/K)</m> maps all principal id&#xe8;les to the identity.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          For <m>K = \QQ</m>, this follows from the explicit description of the Artin map given in <xref ref="D_cyclotomic_reciprocity"/> 
          (or from <xref ref="L_cyclotomic_explicit_reciprocity"/>).
          In general, we have a commutative diagram
          <figure xml:id="fig-connection-2">
          <image>
          <latex-image>
          \xymatrix{
          I_L \ar[r] \ar^{\Norm_{L_w/\QQ_p}}[d] &amp; \Gal(L_w(\zeta_n)/L_w) \ar[d]\\
          I_{\QQ} \ar[r] &amp; \Gal(\QQ_p(\zeta_n)/\QQ_p)
          }
          </latex-image>
          </image>
          </figure>
          and we know the bottom row kills principal id&#xe8;les and the right column is injective.
          Thus the top row kills principal id&#xe8;les too.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      The following is closely analogous to <xref ref="P_H2_lower_bound"/>, in the sense that it says that each class in <m>H^2</m> of an extension of number fields
      can be <q>imported</q> from a cyclotomic extension; the principal difference is that the extension has to be chosen depending on the class.
      (The reason for this will be apparent once we describe Brauer groups in full; see <xref ref="def-fundamental-exact-sequence"/>.)
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-H2-class-absorb-by-cyclotomic">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L/K</m> be a Galois extension of number fields.
          Then for any element <m>x</m> of <m>H^2(L/K)</m>, there exists a cyclic cyclotomic extension <m>M</m> of <m>K</m> and an element <m>y</m> of
          <m>H^2(M/K)</m> such that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> map to the same element of <m>H^2(ML/K)</m>.
          (Here we reprise the shorthand of writing <m>H^i(L/K)</m> to mean <m>H^i(\Gal(L/K), L^*)</m>.)
        </p>
      </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        By <xref ref="T_Albert-Brauer-Hasse-Noether"/> (a consequence of the Second Inequality), any class in <m>H^2(L/K)</m> is determined by its
        images in <m>H^2(L_w/K_v)</m> for all places <m>v</m> in <m>K</m> (where <m>w</m> denotes any place of <m>L</m> above <m>v</m>), with only finitely many of these being
        nonzero. Moreover, a class in <m>H^2(L_w/K_v)</m> of some order <m>m</m> is killed by replacing <m>K_v</m> by any extension of degree <m>m</m>
        (by <xref ref="L_local_invariant_map"/>; see also <xref ref="bib-Milne-CFT"/>, Theorem III.2.1).
        It thus suffices to find a cyclic cyclotomic extension for which, for some fixed finite set of finite places 
        <m>S</m> of <m>K</m>, the degrees <m>[L_w:K_v]</m> for all <m>v \in S</m> are conveniently large; for this, see <xref ref="exer-large-cyclotomic-degree"/>.
        (Compare also <xref ref="bib-Milne-CFT"/>, Proposition VII.7.2.)
      </p>
    </proof>
    </proposition>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Let <m>L/K</m> be an abelian extension of number fields. By <xref ref="T_Albert-Brauer-Hasse-Noether"/> (or rather its proof), we have an injective map
        <me>
          H^2(\Gal(L/K), L^*) \to H^2(\Gal(L/K), I_L) = \bigoplus_v H^2(L_w/K_v).
        </me> 
        is injective. For <m>v</m> a place of <m>K</m>, the group <m>H^2(L_w/K_v)</m> is contained in <m>\frac{1}{2}\ZZ/\ZZ</m> if <m>v</m> is an infinite place,
        and is isomorphic to <m>\frac{1}{[L_w:K_v]} \ZZ/\ZZ</m> if <m>v</m> is a finite place (<xref ref="L_local_invariant_map"/>). 
        By embedding each of these groups into <m>\QQ/\ZZ</m>,
        we get a sum map <m>H^2(\Gal(L/K), I_L) \to \QQ/\ZZ</m>.
      </p>

    <lemma xml:id="lem-H2-map-global">

          Let <m>L/K</m> be an abelian extension of number fields.
          For any map <m>\Gal(L/K) \to \QQ/\ZZ</m>,
          there is a commuting diagram
          <figure xml:id="fig-connection-3">

          </image>
          </figure>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          This is a calculation involving cup products in Galois cohomology which we prefer not to describe in detail.
          See <xref ref="bib-Milne-CFT"/>, Lemma VII.8.5.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-H2-map-global-composite">
      <p>
        In <xref ref="lem-H2-map-global"/>, suppose that <m>L/K</m> is cyclic.
        We may then choose the map <m>\Gal(L/K) \to \QQ/\ZZ</m> to be injective,
        and then the first vertical arrow will be surjective; concretely, 
        it is the composition of <m>K^* \to K^*/\Norm_{L/K} L^* = H^0_T(L^*)</m> with the periodicity isomorphism
        <m>H^0_T(L^*) \to H^2_T(L^*)</m>. If we already knew that <m>r_{L/K}</m> kills principal id&#xe8;les, it would follow that the composite <m>H^2(L^*) \to \QQ/\ZZ</m> is the zero map.
     </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      Let us now apply <xref ref="rmk-H2-map-global-composite"/> in reverse to recover <xref ref="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal"/>.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal3">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any Galois extension <m>L/K</m> of number fields, the map <m>r_{L/K}</m> kills principal id&#xe8;les.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          To begin with, <xref ref="prop-diagonal-cyclotomic"/> implies that <m>r_{L/K}</m> kills principal id&#xe8;les whenever <m>L/K</m> is a cyclotomic extension,
          and <xref ref="rmk-H2-map-global-composite"/> implies that in this case <m>H^2(L^*) \to \QQ/\ZZ</m> vanishes.
          By <xref ref="prop-H2-class-absorb-by-cyclotomic"/>, the same then holds for any Galois extension <m>L/K</m>.
          Now we can use <xref ref="fig-connection-3"/> <q>in reverse</q> to see that for <m>a \in K^*</m>,
          <m>r_{L/K}(a)</m> is killed by any homomorphism <m>\Gal(L/K) \to \QQ/\ZZ</m>.
          Since <m>\Gal(L/K)</m> is an abelian group, that implies <m>r_{L/K}(a)</m> is trivial.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Let <m>L/K</m> be a cyclic extension of number fields.
        At this point, <m>r_{L/K}</m> kills both principal id&#xe8;les (by <xref ref="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal"/>
        and norms (since it does so locally), so it induces a map <m>C_K/\Norm_{L/K} C_L \to \Gal(L/K)</m>.
        By the First Inequality (<xref ref="T_first_inequality"/>), this map is surjective; by comparing orders using the Second Inequality
        (<xref ref="T_first_and_second_inequality"/>), we see that the map is also an isomorphism.
        This establishes the reciprocity law for cyclic extensions, from which it directly follows also for abelian extensions.
        Hooray again!

    <title>More remarks about Brauer groups</title>
    <definition xml:id="def-fundamental-exact-sequence">
      <p>
        Combining the previous discussion with <xref ref="T_Albert-Brauer-Hasse-Noether"/>, 
        we see that for any number field <m>K</m>, the group <m>\Br(K)</m> fits into an exact sequence of the form
        <me>
          0 \to \Br(K^*) \to \bigoplus_v \Br(K_v^*) \to \QQ/\ZZ \to 0
        </me>
        in which 
        <me>
          \Br(K_v^*) = \begin{cases} \QQ/\ZZ &amp; \mbox{for $v$ finite} \\
          \frac{1}{2} \ZZ/\ZZ &amp; \mbox{for $v$ real} \\
          0 &amp; \mbox{for $v$ complex}. \end{cases}
        </me>
        This exact sequence (sometimes called the <term>Fundamental Exact Sequence</term>) plays a key role in various applications of Brauer groups, such as their use to detect obstructions to the existence of rational points
        on algebraic varieties over number fields (called <term>Brauer-Manin obstructions</term>).
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        The property of a field <m>K</m> of characteristic 0 having trivial Brauer group is useful in the theory of finite group representations:
        for such a field, any <m>K</m>-valued character of a finite group arises from a representation defined over <m>K</m>. (This follows from <term>Schur's lemma</term>:
        the character in question appears within some irreducible <m>K</m>-linear representation, whose endomorphism ring is a division algebra;
        the triviality of the Brauer group forces this to split without any base extension.)
        By contrast,
        for <m>G = \{\pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k\}</m>, the standard 2-dimensional representation has a <m>\QQ</m>-valued character but cannot be realized
        as a representation over <m>\QQ</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By <xref ref="prop-H2-class-absorb-by-cyclotomic"/>, the field <m>\QQ^{\ab}</m> has trivial Brauer group. Since in addition every complex character of a finite group
        has values in <m>\QQ^{\ab}</m>, it follows that every irreducible complex representation of a finite group can be realized over <m>\QQ^{\ab}</m>;
        for a more direct proof of this, see <xref ref="bib-Serre-LinRep"/>, Chapter 12, Theorem 24.
