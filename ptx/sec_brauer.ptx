      We sketch another, cohomological approach to the reciprocity isomorphism
      using <m>H^2</m> and an explicit computation in local class field theory.
      One of the sketchy points is that this computation requires a little of the Lubin-Tate construction,
      which makes the local existence theorem rather explicit but will not be discussed herein.

    <title>An explicit computation in local CFT</title>
    <p>
      We sketch an alternate approach for comparing the
      <q>abstract</q>
      reciprocity map <m>r'_{L/K}</m> with the product <m>r_{L/K}</m> of the local reciprocity maps,
      following <xref ref="bib-Milne-CFT"/>. (See also <xref ref="bib-Neukirch"/> V.2.)
    </p>
    <p>
      We first verify that <m>r = r'</m> for cyclotomic extensions of <m>\QQ</m>,
      using an explicit computation in local class field theory.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="L_cyclotomic_explicit_reciprocity">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Via the identifications <m>\Gal(\QQ(\zeta_{p^m})/\QQ)</m> with <m>(\ZZ/p^m\ZZ)^*</m>, we have
          <me>
            r_{\QQ_{\ell}(\zeta_{p^m})/\QQ_{\ell}}(a) = \begin{cases}\sign(a) \amp  \ell = \infty \\ \ell^{v_{\ell}}(a) \amp  \ell \neq \infty, p \\ u^{-1} \amp  \ell = p. \end{cases}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          This is straightforward for <m>\ell = \infty</m>.
          For <m>\ell \neq \infty,
          p</m>, we have an unramified extension of local fields,
          where we know the local reciprocity map takes a uniformizer to a Frobenius.
          In this case the latter is simply <m>\ell</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hard work is in the case <m>\ell=p</m>.
          For that computation one uses what amounts to a very special case of the Lubin-Tate construction of explicit class field theory for local fields,
          using formal groups.
          Put <m>K = \QQ_p</m>,
          <m>\zeta = \zeta_{p^m}</m> and <m>L = \QQ_p(\zeta)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose without loss of generality that <m>u</m> is a positive integer,
          and let <m>\sigma \in \Gal(L/K)</m> be the automorphism corresponding to <m>u^{-1}</m>.
          Since <m>L/K</m> is totally ramified at <m>p</m>,
          we have <m>\Gal(L/K) \cong \Gal(L^{\unr}/K^{\unr})</m>,
          and we can view <m>\sigma</m> as an element of <m>\Gal(L^{\unr}/K)</m>.
          Let <m>\phi_L \in \Gal(L^{\unr}/L)</m> denote the Frobenius,
          and put <m>\tau = \sigma \phi_L</m>.
          Then <m>\tau</m> restricts to the Frobenius in
          <m>\Gal(K^{\unr}/K)</m> and to <m>\sigma</m> in <m>\Gal(L/K)</m>.
          By Neukirch's definition of the reciprocity map,
          we may compute <m>r^{-1}_{L/K}(\sigma)</m> as <m>\Norm_{M/K} \pi_M</m>,
          where <m>M</m> is the fixed field of <m>\tau</m> and <m>\pi_M</m> is a uniformizer.
          We want that norm to be <m>u</m> times a norm from <m>L</m> to <m>K</m>, i.e.,
          <me>
            r^{-1}_{L/K}(\sigma) \in u \Norm_{L/K} L^*
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Define the polynomial
          <me>
            e(x) = x^p + upx
          </me>
          and put
          <me>
            P(x) = e^{(n-1)}(x)^{p-1} + pu
          </me>,
          where <m>e^{(k+1)}(x) = e(e^{(k)}(u))</m>.
          Then <m>P(x)</m> satisfies Eisenstein's criterion,
          so its splitting field over <m>\QQ_p</m> is totally ramified,
          any root of <m>P</m> is a uniformizer,
          and the norm of said uniformizer is <m>(-1)^{[L:K]} pu \in \Norm_{L/K} L^*</m>,
          since <m>\Norm_{L/K}(\zeta-1) = (-1)^{[L:K]}(p)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The punch line is that the splitting field of <m>P(x)</m> is precisely <m>M</m>!
          Here is where the Lubin-Tate construction comes to the rescue... and where I will stop this sketch.
          See <xref ref="bib-Neukirch"/> V.2 and V.4 and/or <xref ref="bib-Milne-CFT"/> I.3.

    <title>A bit about Brauer groups</title>
    <p>
      We complete the cohomological approach to comparing reciprocity maps using some considerations about groups of the form <m>H^2(L/K)</m>.
      Remember that these are <term>Brauer groups</term>; for background,
      see <xref ref="bib-Milne-CFT"/>, IV. We'll be following <xref ref="bib-Milne-CFT"/> VII.8,
      and omitting many details.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-diagonal-cyclotomic">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Put <m>L = K(\zeta_n)</m>.
          Then <m>r_{L/K}: I_K \to \Gal(L/K)</m> maps all principal id&#xe8;les to the identity.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        For <m>K = \QQ</m>, this follows from <xref ref="L_cyclotomic_explicit_reciprocity"/>
        (factor <m>n</m> into prime powers and apply the previous argument to each factor).
        In general, we have a compatibility

      I_L \ar[r] \ar^{\Norm_{L_w/\QQ_p}}[d] &amp; \Gal(L_w(\zeta_n)/L_w) \ar[d]\\

        and we know the bottom row kills principal id&#xe8;les and the right column is injective.
        Thus the top row kills principal id&#xe8;les too.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      To make more progress, we need to bring in <m>H^2</m>,
      as we did in local reciprocity.
      Unfortunately,
      trying to compute <m>H^2</m> of the id&#xe8;le class group is a headache,
      so we can't imitate the argument perfectly (or else we would have done so already).
    </p>
    <p>
      What we can do is imitate the argument that in the local case, every element of <m>H^2(L/K)</m> could be
      <q>brought in</q>
      from a suitable unramified extension of <m>K</m> (see the proof of <xref ref="P_H2_lower_bound"/>).
      We have a similar situation here with <q>unramified</q> replaced by <q>cyclotomic</q>.

    <proposition xml:id="prop-H2-class-absorb-by-cyclotomic">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L/K</m> be a Galois extension of number fields.
          Then for any element <m>x</m> of
          <m>H^2(\Gal(L/K), L^*)</m>, there exists a cyclic,
          cyclotomic extension <m>M</m> of <m>K</m> and an element <m>y</m> of
          <m>H^2(\Gal(M/K), M^*)</m> such that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> map to the same element of <m>H^2(\Gal(ML/K), ML^*)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        By <xref ref="T_Albert-Brauer-Hasse-Noether"/> (a consequence of the Second Inequality), any class in <m>H^2(\Gal(L/K), L^*)</m> is determined by its
        images in <m>H^2(\Gal(L_w/K_v), L_w^*)</m> for all places <m>v</m> in <m>K</m> (where <m>w</m> denotes any place of <m>L</m> above <m>v</m>.)
        Moreover, only finitely many of these quantities are nonzero. It thus suffices to find a cyclic cyclotomic extension for which, for some fixed finite set of finite places 
        <m>S</m> of <m>K</m>, the degrees <m>[L_w:K_v]</m> for all <m>v \in S</m> are conveniently large. See <xref ref="exer-large-cyclotomic-degree"/>.

        Let <m>L/K</m> be an abelian extension of number fields.
        From the exact sequence
        <me>
          0 \to L^* \to I_L \to C_L \to 0
        </me>
        we get an exact sequence
        <me>
          1 = H^1(\Gal(L/K), C_L) \to H^2(\Gal(L/K), L^*) \to H^2(\Gal(L/K), I_L),
        </me>
        from which we see that the map 
        <me>
          H^2(\Gal(L/K), L^*) \to H^2(\Gal(L/K), I_L) = \bigoplus H^2(\Gal(L/K), I_L)
        </me> 
        is injective.
        Each factor in the direct sum is canonically a subgroup of <m>\QQ/\ZZ</m>,
        so we get a sum map <m>H^2(\Gal(L/K), I_L) \to \QQ/\ZZ</m>.

    <remark xml:id="rmk-H2-map-global-composite">
      <p>
        In <xref ref="lem-H2-map-global"/>, suppose that <m>L/K</m> is cyclic.
        We may then choose the map <m>\Gal(L/K) \to \QQ/\ZZ</m> to be injective,
        and then the first vertical arrow will be surjective; concretely, 
        it is the composition of <m>K^* \to K^*/\Norm_{L/K} L^* = H^0_T(L^*)</m> with the periodicity isomorphism
        <m>H^0_T(L^*) \to H^2_T(L^*)</m>. If we already knew that <m>r_{L/K}</m> kills principal id&#xe8;les, it would follow that the composite <m>H^2(L^*) \to \QQ/\ZZ</m> is the zero map.
     </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      Let us now apply <xref ref="rmk-H2-map-global-composite"/> in reverse to recover <xref ref="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal"/>.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal3">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any Galois extension <m>L/K</m> of number fields, the map <m>r_{L/K}</m> kills principal id&#xe8;les.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          To begin with, <xref ref="prop-diagonal-cyclotomic"/> implies that <m>r_{L/K}</m> kills principal id&#xe8;les whenever <m>L/K</m> is a cyclotomic extension,
          and <xref ref="rmk-H2-map-global-composite"/> implies that in this case <m>H^2(L^*) \to \QQ/\ZZ</m> vanishes.
          By <xref ref="prop-H2-class-absorb-by-cyclotomic"/>, the same then holds for any Galois extension <m>L/K</m>.
          Now we can use <xref ref="fig-connection-3"/> <q>in reverse</q> to see that for <m>a \in K^*</m>,
          <m>r_{L/K}(a)</m> is killed by any homomorphism <m>\Gal(L/K) \to \QQ/\ZZ</m>.
          Since <m>\Gal(L/K)</m> is an abelian group, that implies <m>r_{L/K}(a)</m> is trivial.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      To conclude, let <m>L/K</m> be a cyclic extension of number fields.
      At this point, <m>r_{L/K}</m> kills both principal id&#xe8;les (by <xref ref="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal"/>
      and norms (since it does so locally), so it induces a map <m>C_K/\Norm_{L/K} C_L \to \Gal(L/K)</m>.
      By the First Inequality (<xref ref="T_first_inequality"/>), this map is surjective; by comparing orders using the Second Inequality
      (<xref ref="T_first_and_second_inequality"/>), we see that the map is also an isomorphism.
      This establishes the reciprocity law for cyclic extensions, from which it directly follows also for abelian extensions.
      Hooray again!
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-fundamental-exact-sequence">
      <p>
        Combining the previous discussion with <xref ref="T_Albert-Brauer-Hasse-Noether"/>, 
        we see that for any number field <m>K</m>, the group <m>H^2(K^*) = H^2(\Gal(\overline{K}/K), \overline{K}^*)</m> fits into an exact sequence of the form
        <me>
          0 \to H^2(K^*) \to \bigoplus_v H^2(K_v^*) \to \QQ/\ZZ \to 0
        </me>
        in which 
        <me>
          H^2(K_v^*) = \begin{cases} \QQ/\ZZ &amp; \mbox{for $v$ finite} \\
          \frac{1}{2} \ZZ &amp; \mbox{for $v$ real} \\
          0 &amp; \mbox{for $v$ complex}. \end{cases}
        </me>
        This exact sequence (sometimes called the <term>Fundamental Exact Sequence</term>) plays a key role in various applications of Brauer groups, such as their use to detect obstructions to the existence of rational points
        on algebraic varieties over number fields (called <term>Brauer-Manin obstructions</term>).
