      By analogy with local class field theory,
      we want to prove that for <m>K,L</m> number fields and
      <m>C_K, C_L</m> their id&#xe8;le class groups,
      <me>
        H^1(\Gal(L/K), C_L) = 1, \qquad H^2(\Gal(L/K), C_L) = \ZZ/[L:K]\ZZ
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this chapter,
      we'll look at the special case <m>L/K</m> cyclic, and prove that
      <me>
        \#H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), C_L)/\#H^1_T(\Gal(L/K), C_L) = [L:K]
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is, the Herbrand quotient of <m>C_L</m> is <m>[L:K]</m>.
      As we'll see,
      this will end up reducing to looking at units in a real vector space,
      much as in the proof of Dirichlet's units theorem.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will imply the
      <q>First Inequality</q>.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_first_inequality">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>L/K</m> a cyclic extension of number fields,
          <me>
            \#H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), C_L) \geq [L:K]
          </me>.

      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      The
      <q>Second Inequality</q>
      will be the reverse, which will be a bit more subtle
      (see <xref ref="T_first_and_second_inequality">Theorem</xref>).

    <title>Some basic observations</title>
    <p>
      But first, some general observations.
      Put <m>G = \Gal(L/K)</m>.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For each <m>i>0</m>, <m>H^i(G, I_L) = \oplus_v H^i(G_v, L_v^*)</m>.
          For each <m>i</m>, <m>H^i_T(G, I_L) = \oplus_v H^i_T(G_v, L_v^*)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        For any finite set <m>S</m> of places of <m>K</m> containing all infinite places and all ramified primes,
        let <m>I_{L,S}</m> be the set of id\<sq>eles with a unit at each component other than at the places dividing any places in <m>S</m>.
        Note that <m>I_{L,S}</m> is stable under <m>G</m>
        (because we defined it in terms of places of <m>K</m>,
        not <m>L</m>).
        By definition,
        <m>I_L</m> is the direct limit of the <m>I_{L,S}</m> over all <m>S</m>,
        so <m>H^i(G,I_L)</m> is the direct limit of the <m>H^i(G, I_{L,S})</m>.
        The latter is the product of
        <m>H^i(G, \prod_{w|v} L_w^*)</m> over all <m>v \in S</m> and
        <m>H^i(G, \prod_{w|v} \gotho_{L_w}^*)</m> over all <m>v \notin S</m>,
        but the latter is trivial because <m>v \notin S</m> cannot ramify.
        By Shapiro</sq>s lemma
        (<xref ref="L_Shapiro">Lemma</xref>),
        <m>H^i(G, \prod_{w|v} L_w^*) = H^i(G_v, L_w^*)</m>, so we have what we want.
        The argument for Tate groups is analogous.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Notice what this says for <m>i=0</m> on the Tate groups:
      an id&#xe8;le is a norm if and only if each component is a norm.
      Obvious, perhaps, but useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular,
      <me>
        H^1(G, I_L) = 0, \qquad H^2(G, I_L) = \bigoplus_v \frac{1}{[L_w:K_v]} \ZZ/\ZZ
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      One other observation:
      if <m>S</m> contains all infinite places and all ramified places, then
      <me>
        \Norm_{L/K} I_{L,S} = \prod_{v \in S} U_v \times \prod_{v \notin S} \gotho_{K_v}^*
      </me>
      where <m>U_v</m> is open in <m>K_v^*</m>.
      The group on the right is open in <m>I_K</m>,
      so <m>\Norm_{L/K} I_K</m> is open.
    </p>
    <p>
      By quotienting down to <m>C_K</m>,
      we see that <m>\Norm_{L/K} C_K</m> is open.
      In fact, the snake lemma on the diagram
    </p>
      <figure xml:id="fig-ideles-cohom1-1">
      <image>
      <latex-image>
      \xymatrix{
      0 \ar[r] &amp; L^* \ar[r] \ar^{\Norm_{L/K}}[d] &amp; I_L \ar[r] \ar^{\Norm_{L/K}}[d] &amp; C_L \ar[r] \ar^{\Norm_{L/K}}[d] &amp; 0 \\
      0 \ar[r] &amp; K^* \ar[r] &amp; I_K \ar[r] &amp; C_K \ar[r] &amp; 0

      </latex-image>
      </image>
      </figure>
    <p>
      implies that the quotient <m>I_K/(K^* \times \Norm_{L/K} I_L)</m> is isomorphic to <m>C_K</m>.
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Cohomology of the units</title>
    <p>
      Remember, we're going to be assuming
      <m>G = \Gal(L/K)</m> is cyclic until further notice,
      so that we may use periodicity of the Tate groups,
      and the Herbrand quotient.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all,
      working with <m>I_L</m> all at once is a bit unwieldy;
      we'd rather work with <m>I_{L,S}</m> for some finite set <m>S</m>.
      In fact, we can choose <m>S</m> to make our lives easier:
      we choose <m>S</m> containing all infinite places,
      and all ramified primes, and perhaps some extra primes so that
      <me>
        I_L = I_{L,S} L^*
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is possible because the ideal class group of <m>L</m> is finite,
      so it is generated by some finite set of primes,
      which we introduce into <m>S</m>;
      then I can move a generator of any other prime to some stuff in <m>S</m> times units.
      (This argument can also be used to prove that <m>C^0_L</m> is compact,
      but then one doesn't recover the finiteness of the ideal class group as a corollary.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Put <m>L_S = L^* \cap I_{L,S}</m>;
      that is, <m>L_S</m> is the group of <m>S</m>-units in <m>L</m>.
      From the exact sequence
      <me>
        1 \to L_S \to I_{L,S} \to I_{L,S}/L_S = C_L \to 1
      </me>
      we have, in case <m>L/K</m> is cyclic,
      an equality of Herbrand quotients
      <me>
        h(C_L) = h(I_{L,S})/h(L_S)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the computation of <m>H^i(G, I_{L,S})</m>,
      it's easy to read off its Herbrand quotient:
      <me>
        h(I_{L,S}) = \prod_{v \in S} \#H^0_T(G_v, L_w^*)= \prod_{v \in S} [L_w:K_v]
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So to get <m>h(C_L) = [L:K]</m>, we need
      <me>
        h(L_S) = \frac{1}{[L:K]} \prod_{v \in S} [L_w:K_v]
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will in fact be true even if we only assume <m>S</m> contains all infinite places,
      as we now check.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>T</m> be the set of places of <m>L</m> dividing the places of <m>S</m>.
      Let <m>V</m> be the real vector space consisting of one copy of <m>\RR</m> for each place in <m>T</m>.
      Define the map <m>L_S \to V</m> by sending
      <me>
        \alpha \to \prod_w \log |\alpha|_w
      </me>,
      with the caveat that the norm at a complex place is the <em>square</em>
      of the usual absolute value;
      the kernel of this map consists solely of roots of unity
      (by Kronecker's theorem:
      any algebraic integer whose conjugates in <m>\CC</m> all have norm 1 is a root of unity).
      Let <m>M</m> be the quotient of <m>L_S</m> by the group of roots of unity;
      since the latter is finite, <m>h(M) = h(L_S)</m>.
      Let <m>H \subset V</m> be the hyperplane of vectors with sum of coordinates 0;
      by the product formula, <m>M</m> maps into <m>H</m>.
      As noted earlier,
      in fact <m>M</m> is a discrete subgroup of <m>H</m> of rank equal to the dimension of <m>H</m>;
      that is, <m>M</m> is a lattice in <m>H</m>.
      Moreover, we have an action of <m>G</m> on <m>V</m> compatible with the embedding of <m>M</m>;
      namely, <m>G</m> acts on the places in <m>T</m>,
      so acts on <m>V</m> by permuting the coordinates.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Caveat</title>
    <p>
      There seems to be an error in Neukirch's derivation at this point.
      Namely, his Lemma VI.3.4 is only proved assuming that <m>G</m> acts transitively on the coordinates of <m>V</m>;
      but in the above situation, this is not the case:
      <m>G</m> permutes the places above any given place <m>v</m> of <m>K</m> but those are separate orbits.
      So we'll follow Milne instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can write down two natural lattices in <m>V</m>.
      One of them is the lattice generated by <m>M</m> together with the all-ones vector,
      on which <m>G</m> acts trivially.
      As a <m>G</m>-module,
      the Herbrand quotient of that lattice is <m>h(M) h(\ZZ) = [L:K] h(M)</m>.
      The other is the lattice <m>M'</m> in which,
      in the given coordinate system,
      each element has integral coordinates.
      To compute its Herbrand quotient,
      notice that the projection of this lattice onto the coordinates corresponding to the places <m>w</m> above some <m>v</m> form a copy of <m>\Ind^G_{G_v} \ZZ</m>.
      Thus
      <me>
        h(G, M') = \prod_v h(G, \Ind^G_{G_v} \ZZ) = \prod_v h(G_v, \ZZ) = \prod_v \#G_v = \prod_v [L_w:K_v]
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So all that remains is to prove the following.
    </p>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>V</m> be a real vector space on which a finite group <m>G</m> acts linearly,
          and let <m>L_1</m> and <m>L_2</m> be <m>G</m>-stable lattices in <m>V</m> for which <m>h(L_1)</m> and <m>h(L_2)</m> are both defined.
          Then <m>h(L_1) = h(L_2)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <p>
      In fact, one can show that if one of the Herbrand quotients is defined,
      so is the other.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We first show that <m>L_1 \otimes_{\ZZ} \QQ</m> and
        <m>L_2 \otimes_{\ZZ} \QQ</m> are isomorphic as <m>\QQ[G]</m>-modules.
        We are given that <m>L_1 \otimes_{\ZZ} \RR</m> and
        <m>L_2 \otimes_{\ZZ} \RR</m> are isomorphic as <m>\RR[G]</m>-modules.
        That is, the real vector space <m>W = \Hom_{\RR}(L_1 \otimes_{\ZZ} \RR, L_2 \otimes_{\ZZ} \RR)</m>,
        on which <m>G</m> acts by the formula <m>T^g(x) = T(x^{g^{-1}})^g</m>,
        contains an invariant vector which,
        as a linear transformation, is invertible.
        Now <m>W</m> can also be written as
        <me>
          \Hom_{\ZZ}(L_1, L_2) \otimes_{\ZZ} \RR;
        </me>
        that is, <m>\Hom_{\ZZ}(L_1, L_2)</m> sits inside as a sublattice.
        The fact that <m>W</m> has an invariant vector says that a certain set of linear equations has a nonzero solution over <m>\RR</m>,
        namely the equations that express the fact that the action of <m>G</m> leaves the vector invariant.
        But those equations have coefficients in <m>\QQ</m>,
        so there must already be invariant vectors over <m>\QQ</m>.
        Moreover, if we fix an isomorphism
        (not <m>G</m>-equivariant)
        between <m>L_2 \otimes_{\ZZ} \RR</m> and <m>L_1 \otimes_{\ZZ} \RR</m>,
        we can compose this with any element of <m>W</m> to get a map from <m>L_1</m> to itself,
        which has a determinant;
        and by hypothesis,
        there is some invariant vector of <m>W</m> whose determinant is nonzero.
        Thus the determinant doesn't vanish identically on the set of invariant vectors in <m>W</m>,
        so it also doesn't vanish identically on the set of invariant vectors in <m>\Hom_{\ZZ}(L_1, L_2) \otimes_{\ZZ} \QQ</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus there is a <m>G</m>-equivariant isomorphism between
        <m>L_1 \otimes_{\ZZ} \QQ</m> and <m>L_2 \otimes_{\ZZ} \QQ</m>;
        that is, <m>L_1</m> is isomorphic to a sublattice of <m>L_2</m>.
        Since a lattice has the same Herbrand quotient as any sublattice
        (the quotient is finite, so its Herbrand quotient is 1),
        that means <m>h(L_1) = h(L_2)</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>

  <subsection>
    <title>Aside: splitting of primes</title>
    <p>
      As a consequence of the First Inequality,
      we record the following fact which is <em>a posteriori</em>
      an immediate consequence of the adelic reciprocity law,
      but which will be needed in the course of the proofs. (See Neukirch, Corollary VI.3.8 for more details).
    </p>
    <corollary xml:id="C_split_completely">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any nontrivial extension <m>L/K</m> of number fields,
          there are infinitely many primes of <m>K</m> which do not split completely in <m>L</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </corollary>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose first that <m>L/K</m> is of prime order.
        Then if all but finitely many primes split completely,
        we can put the remaining primes into <m>S</m> and deduce that <m>C_K = \Norm_{L/K} C_L</m>,
        whereas the above calculation forces <m>H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), C_L) \geq [L:K]</m>,
        contradiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the general case, let <m>M</m> be the Galois closure of <m>L/K</m>;
        then a prime of <m>K</m> splits completely in <m>L</m> if and only if it splits completely in <m>M</m>.
        Since <m>\Gal(M/K)</m> is a nontrivial finite group,
        it contains a cyclic subgroup of prime order;
        let <m>N</m> be the fixed field of this subgroup.
        By the previous paragraph,
        there are infinitely many prime ideals of <m>N</m> which do not split completely in <m>M</m>,
        proving the original result.
      </p>
    </proof>
