      If you catch me writing <m>H^i(L/K)</m> for <m>L/K</m> a Galois extension of fields,
      that's shorthand for <m>H^i(\Gal(L/K), L^*)</m>.
      Likewise for <m>H_i</m> or <m>H^i_T</m>.

    <title>Overview</title>
    <p>
      We now make some computations of
      <m>H^i_T(L/K)</m> for <m>L/K</m> a finite Galois extension of local fields.
      To begin with, recall that by
      <q>Theorem 90</q>
      (<xref ref="L_theorem_90">Lemma</xref>), <m>H^1(L/K) = 0</m>.
      Our goal in this section will be to supplement this fact with a computation of <m>H^2(L/K)</m>.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="P_local_h2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any finite Galois extension <m>L/K</m> of local fields,
          <m>H^2(L/K)</m> is cyclic of order <m>[L:K]</m>.
          Moreover, this group can be canonically identified with
          <m>\frac{1}{[L:K]}\ZZ/\ZZ</m> in such a way that if <m>M/L</m> is another finite extension such that <m>M/K</m> is also Galois,
          the inflation homomorphism
          <m>H^2(L/K) \to H^2(M/K)</m> corresponds to the inclusion <m>\frac{1}{[L:K]}\ZZ/\ZZ \subseteq \frac{1}{[M:K]}\ZZ/\ZZ</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <remark>
    <p>
      Before continuing,
      it is worth keeping in a safe place the exact sequence
      <me>
        1 \to \gotho_L^* \to L^* \to L^*/\gotho_L^* = \pi_L^\ZZ \to 1
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this exact sequence of <m>G = \Gal(L/K)</m>-modules,
      the action on <m>\pi_L^\ZZ</m> is always trivial
      (since the valuation on <m>L</m> is Galois-invariant).
    </p>
    </remark>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-local-galois-solvable">
    <p>
      Another basic fact to keep in mind is that any finite Galois extension of local fields is <em>solvable</em>.
      To wit, the maximal unramified extension is cyclic,; the maximal tamely ramified extension is cyclic over that;
      and the rest is a Galois extension whose degree is a power of <m>p</m>, and every finite <m>p</m>-group is solvable.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will allow us to simplify some of the following arguments by writing a general Galois extension as a tower of successive
      cyclic extensions. Of course we will have no such shortcut in the global case, because the Galois group of a Galois extension of number
      fields can be any group whatsoever; in fact the inverse Galois problem asks whether this always occurs for an extension over <m>\QQ</m>,
      and no counterexample is known.

    <title>The unramified case</title>
    <p>
      Recall that unramified extensions are cyclic,
      since their Galois groups are also the Galois groups of extensions of finite fields.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="P_finite_norm_surjective">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any finite extension <m>L/K</m> of <em>finite</em> fields,
          the map <m>\Norm_{L/K}: L^* \to K^*</m> is surjective.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        One can certainly give an elementary proof of this using the fact that <m>L^*</m> is cyclic
        (see <xref ref="exer-norm-map-finite"/>).
        But one can also see it using the machinery we have at hand.
        Because <m>L^*</m> is a finite module, its Herbrand quotient is 1.
        Also, we know <m>H^1_T(L/K)</m> is trivial by <xref ref="L_theorem_90">Lemma</xref>.
        Thus <m>H^0_T(L/K)</m> is trivial too, that is, <m>\Norm_{L/K}: L^* \to K^*</m> is surjective.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <proposition xml:id="P_unramified_norm_surjective">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any finite unramified extension <m>L/K</m> of local fields, the map <m>\Norm_{L/K}: \gotho_L^* \to \gotho_K^*</m> is surjective.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Say <m>u \in \gotho_K^*</m> is a unit.
        By <xref ref="P_finite_norm_surjective"/>, we may pick <m>v_0 \in \gotho_L^*</m> such that in the residue fields,
        the norm of <m>v_0</m> coincides with <m>u</m>.
        Thus <m>u/\Norm(v_0) \equiv 1 \pmod{\pi}</m>, where <m>\pi</m> is a uniformizer of <m>K</m>.
        Now we construct units <m>v_i \equiv 1 \pmod{\pi^i}</m> such that <m>u_i = u/\Norm(v_0\cdots v_i) \equiv 1 \pmod{\pi^{i+1}}</m>:
        simply take <m>v_i</m> so that <m>\Trace((1-v_i)/\pi^i) \equiv (1-u_{i-1})/\pi^i \pmod{\pi}</m>.
        (That's possible because the trace map on residue fields is surjective by the normal basis theorem.)
        Then the product <m>v_0v_1\cdots</m> converges to a unit <m>v</m> with norm <m>u</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <corollary xml:id="C_cohomology_of_units_unramified">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any finite unramified extensions <m>L/K</m> of local fields, <m>H^i_T(\Gal(L/K), \gotho_L^*) = 1</m> for all <m>i \in \ZZ</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </corollary>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Again, <m>\Gal(L/K)</m> is cyclic, so by <xref ref="T_cyclic_group_periodicity"/> we need only check this for <m>i=0,1</m>.
        For <m>i=0</m>, it is <xref ref="P_unramified_norm_surjective"/>.
        For <m>i=1</m>, note that because <m>L/K</m> is unramified, we can split the surjection <m>L^* \to L^*/\gotho_L^*</m>
        by choosing a uniformizer <m>\pi_K</m> of <m>K</m> and writing <m>L^* = \gotho_L^* \pi_K^\ZZ</m>. Hence
        <m>H^1_T(\Gal(L/K), \gotho_L^*)</m> is a direct summand of <m>H^1_T(\Gal(L/K), L^*)</m>, and the latter vanishes by <xref ref="L_theorem_90"/>. 
      </p>
    </proof>
    <proposition xml:id="P_H2_unramified">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any finite unramified extension <m>L/K</m> of local fields,
          <m>H^2(L/K)</m> is cyclic of order <m>[L:K]</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        Using the Herbrand quotient, we get <m>h(L^*) = h(\gotho_L^*) h(\ZZ)</m>.
        <xref ref="C_cohomology_of_units_unramified"/> says that <m>h(\gotho_L^*) = 1</m>, and
        <md>
          <mrow>h(L^*/\gotho_L^*) \amp = h(\ZZ)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = \#H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), \ZZ)/\#H^1_T(\Gal(L/K), \ZZ)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = \#\Gal(L/K)^{\ab} / \#\Hom(\Gal(L/K), \ZZ)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = [L:K].</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>H^1_T(\Gal(L/K), L^*)</m> is trivial,
        we conclude that <m>H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), L^*)</m> has order <m>[L:K]</m>.
        Moreover, the long exact sequence of Tate groups gives an exact sequence
        <me>
          1 \to H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), L^*) \to H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), \ZZ) = \Gal(L/K) \to 1,
        </me>
        where the ends vanish by <xref ref="C_cohomology_of_units_unramified"/> again;
        so by periodicity (<xref ref="T_cyclic_group_periodicity"/>) we also get that <m>H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), L^*) \cong H^2(L/K)</m> is cyclic of order <m>[L:K]</m>.
      </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      Let us now make the description of <m>H^2(L/K)</m> more canonical.
      Consider the short exact sequence
      <me>
        0 \to \ZZ \to \QQ \to \QQ/\ZZ \to 0
      </me>
      of modules with trivial Galois action.
      Since <m>\QQ</m> is injective as an abelian group,
      it is also injective as a <m>G</m>-module for any group <m>G</m>
      (<xref ref="exer-trivial-module-injective"/>).
      Thus we get an isomorphism <m>H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), \ZZ) \to H^{-1}_T(\Gal(L/K), \QQ/\ZZ)</m>.
      But the latter is
      <me>
        H^1(\Gal(L/K), \QQ/\ZZ) = \Hom(\Gal(L/K), \QQ/\ZZ);
      </me>
      since <m>\Gal(L/K)</m> has a canonical generator (Frobenius),
      we can evaluate there and get a canonical map 
      <me>
        \Hom(\Gal(L/K), \QQ/\ZZ) \to \ZZ/[L:K]\ZZ \subset \QQ/\ZZ.
      </me>.
      Putting it all together, we get a canonical map
      <me>
        H^2(\Gal(L/K), L^*) \cong H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), L^*) \cong H^1(\Gal(L/K), \QQ/\ZZ) \hookrightarrow \QQ/\ZZ
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this special case, this is none other than the local invariant map!
      In fact, by taking direct limits,
      we get a canonical isomorphism
      <me>
        H^2(K^{\unr}/K) \cong \QQ/\ZZ
      </me>.
    </p>
    <remark>
    <p>
      What's really going on here is that
      <m>H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), L^*)</m> is a cyclic group generated by a uniformizer <m>\pi</m> (since every unit is a norm).
      Under the map <m>H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), L^*) \to \QQ/\ZZ</m>, that uniformizer is being mapped to <m>1/[L:K]</m>.

    <title>The cyclic case</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>L/K</m> be a cyclic but possibly ramified extension of local fields.
      Again, <m>H^1_T(L/K)</m> is trivial by <xref ref="L_theorem_90">Lemma</xref>,
      so all there is to compute is <m>H^0_T(L/K)</m>.
      We are going to show again that it has order <m>[L:K]</m>.
      (It's actually cyclic again, but we won't prove this just yet.)
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="L_open_subgroup_acyclic">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L/K</m> be a finite Galois extension of local fields.
          Then there is an open, Galois-stable subgroup <m>V</m> of <m>\gotho_L</m> such that
          <m>H^i(\Gal(L/K), V) = 0</m> for all <m>i>0</m> (i.e., <m>V</m> is acyclic for cohomology).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        By the normal basis theorem,
        there exists <m>\alpha \in L</m> such that
        <m>\{\alpha^g:
        g \in \Gal(L/K)\}</m> is a basis for <m>L</m> over <m>K</m>.
        Without loss of generality, we may rescale to get <m>\alpha \in \gotho_L</m>;
        then put <m>V = \sum \gotho_K \alpha^g</m>.
        As in the proof of <xref ref="T_additive_theorem_90">Theorem</xref>,
        <m>V</m> is induced:
        <m>V = \Ind^G_{1} \gotho_K</m>, so is acyclic.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      The following proof uses that we are in characteristic 0, but it can be modified to work also in the function field case.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="L_open_subgroup_acyclic1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L/K</m> be a finite Galois extension of local fields.
          Then there is an open, Galois-stable subgroup <m>W</m> of
          <m>\gotho_L^*</m> such that <m>H^i(\Gal(L/K), W) = 0</m> for all <m>i>0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Take <m>V</m> as in <xref ref="L_open_subgroup_acyclic"/>.
        If we choose <m>\alpha</m> sufficiently divisible,
        then <m>V</m> lies in the radius of convergence of the exponential series
        <me>
          \exp(x) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{x^i}{i!}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        (you need <m>v_p(x) > 1/(p-1)</m>,
        to be precise), and we may take <m>W = \exp(V)</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Take <m>W</m> as in <xref ref="L_open_subgroup_acyclic1"/>.
      Since <m>W</m> has finite index in <m>\gotho_L^*</m>, we have <m>h(\gotho_L^*/W) = 1</m>
      and hence <m>h(\gotho_L^*) = h(W) = 1</m> by <xref ref="L_open_subgroup_acyclic1"/>.
      So again we may conclude that <m>h(L^*) = h(\gotho_L^*) h(\ZZ) = [L:K]</m>,
      and so <m>H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), L^*) = [L:K]</m>.
      However, we cannot yet check that
      <m>H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), L^*)</m> is cyclic because the groups
      <m>H^1_T(\Gal(L/K), \gotho_L^*)</m> are not guaranteed to vanish;
      see <xref ref="exer-units-not-acyclic"/>.

          is exact.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        For <m>r=1</m>, the condition on <m>H^i</m> is empty.
        In this case,
        <m>H^1(G,M)</m> classifies crossed homomorphisms <m>\phi:G \to M</m>.
        If one of these factors through <m>G/H</m>,
        it becomes a constant map when restricted to <m>H</m>;
        if that constant value itself belongs to <m>M^H</m>,
        then it must be zero and so the restriction to <m>H</m> is trivial.
        Conversely, if there exists some <m>m \in M</m> such that
        <m>\phi(h) = m^h - m</m> for all <m>h \in H</m>,
        then <m>\phi'(g) = \phi(g) - m^g + m</m> is another crossed homomorphism representing the same class in <m>H^1(G,M)</m>,
        but taking the value 0 on each <m>h \in H</m>.
        For <m>g \in G, h \in H</m>, we have
        <me>
          \phi'(hg) = \phi'(h)^g + \phi'(g) = \phi'(g)
        </me>,
        so <m>\phi'</m> is constant on cosets of <m>H</m> and so may be viewed as a crossed homomorphism from <m>G/H</m> to <m>M</m>.
        On the other hand,
        <me>
          \phi'(g) = \phi'(gh) = \phi'(g)^h + \phi(h) = \phi'(g)^h
        </me>
        so <m>\phi'</m> takes values in <m>M^H</m>.
        Thus the sequence is exact at <m>H^1(G,M)</m>;
        exactness at <m>H^i(G/H,M^H)</m> is similar but easier.

        The second vertical arrow arises from the long exact sequence for <m>G</m>-cohomology;
        since <m>\Ind^G_{1} M</m> is an induced <m>G</m>-module,
        this arrow is an isomorphism.
        Similarly, the third vertical arrow arises from the long exact sequence for <m>H</m>-cohomology,
        and it is an isomorphism because
        <m>\Ind^G_1 M</m> is also an induced <m>H</m>-module;
        moreover, <m>H^i(H, N) = 0</m> for <m>i=1, \dots, r-2</m>.
        Finally, taking <m>H</m>-invariants yields another exact sequence
        <me>
          0 \to M^H \to (\Ind^G_1 M)^H \to N^H \to H^1(H, M) = 0

        so we may take the long exact sequence for <m>G/H</m>-cohomology to obtain the first vertical arrow;
        it is an isomorphism because
        <m>(\Ind^G_1 M)^H</m> is an induced <m>G/H</m>-module.
        The induction hypothesis implies that the top row is exact,
        so the bottom row is also exact.

    <proposition xml:id="P_H2_upper_bound">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any finite Galois extension <m>L/K</m> of local fields,
          the group <m>H^2(\Gal(L/K), L^*)</m> has order at most <m>[L:K]</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We've checked the case of <m>L/K</m> cyclic,
        so we may use it as the basis for an induction.
        If <m>L/K</m> is not cyclic,
        since it is solvable (<xref ref="rmk-local-galois-solvable"/>), we can find a Galois subextension <m>M/K</m>.
        Now the exact sequence
        <me>
          0 \to H^2(M/K) \to H^2(L/K) \to H^2(L/M)
        </me>
        from <xref ref="C_inflation_restriction_h2"/>
        implies that <m>\#H^2(L/K) \leq \#H^2(M/K) \#H^2(L/M) = [M:K][L:M] = [L:K]</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      To complete the proof that
      <m>H^2(L/K)</m> is cyclic of order <m>[L:K]</m>,
      it now suffices to produce a cyclic subgroup of order <m>[L:K]</m>.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="P_H2_lower_bound">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any finite Galois extension <m>L/K</m> of local fields,
          the group <m>H^2(\Gal(L/K), L^*)</m> contains a cyclic subgroup of order <m>[L:K]</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>M/K</m> be an unramified extension of degree <m>[L:K]</m>.
      Then we have a diagram
    </p>
      <figure xml:id="fig-localcomp-2">
      <image>
      <latex-image>
      \xymatrix{
      &amp; &amp; H^2(M/K) \ar[d]^{\Inf} \ar[rd] &amp;  \\
      0 \ar[r] &amp; H^2(L/K) \ar^{\Inf}[r] &amp; H^2(ML/K) \ar^{\Res}[r] &amp; H^2(ML/L)
      }

      </figure>
    <p>
      in which the bottom row is exact and the vertical arrow is injective,
      both by <xref ref="C_inflation_restriction_h2"/>.
      It suffices to show that the diagonal arrow <m>H^2(M/K) \to H^2(ML/L)</m> is the zero map,
      as this will imply an inclusion <m>H^2(M/K) \subseteq H^2(L/K)</m> within <m>H^2(ML/K)</m>
      and we already know that <m>H^2(M/K)</m> is cyclic of order <m>[M:K]=[L:K]</m>
      by <xref ref="P_H2_unramified"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>e = e(L/K)</m> and <m>f = f(L/K)</m> be the ramification index and residue field degree,
      so that <m>[ML:L] = e</m>.
      Let <m>U</m> be the maximal unramified subextension of <m>L/K</m>;
      then we have a canonical isomorphism <m>\Gal(ML/L) \cong \Gal(M/U)</m> of cyclic groups.
      By using the same generators in both groups,
      we can make a commutative diagram
    </p>
      <figure xml:id="fig-localcomp-3">
      <image>
      <latex-image>
      \xymatrix{
      H^0_T(M/K) \ar^{\Res}[r] \ar[d] &amp; H^0_T(M/U) \ar[r]  \ar[d] &amp; H^0_T(ML/L) \ar[d]  \\
      H^2(M/K) \ar^{\Res}[r] &amp; H^2(M/U) \ar[r] &amp; H^2(ML/L)
      }

    <p>
      in which the vertical arrows are isomorphisms.
      (Remember from <xref ref="D-extended-functoriality-homology"/> that restriction maps on Tate homology make sense in degree 0;
      that gives the first horizontal arrow in <xref ref="fig-localcomp-3"/>.)
      The composition in the bottom row is the map <m>H^2(M/K) \to H^2(ML/L)</m> which we want to be zero;
      it thus suffices to check that the top row composes to zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us rewrite this composition concretely as
      <me>K^*/\Norm_{M/K} M^* \to U^*/\Norm_{M/U} M^* \to L^*/\Norm_{ML/L} (ML)^*</me>
      where the maps are induced by the inclusions <m>K^* \to U^* \to L^*</m>.
      Now <m>K^*/\Norm_{M/K} M^*</m> is a cyclic group of order <m>ef</m> generated by <m>\pi_K</m>,
      a uniformizer of <m>K</m>,
      and <m>L^*/\Norm_{ML/L} (ML)^*</m> is a cyclic group of order <m>e</m> generated by <m>\pi_L</m>,
      a uniformizer of <m>L</m>.
      But <m>\pi_K</m> is a unit of
      <m>\gotho_L</m> times <m>\pi_L^e</m>,
      so the map in question is indeed zero.
    </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
  <remark>
    <p>
      If <m>L/K</m> is a finite extension of degree <m>n</m>,
      then the map <m>\Res: H^2(K^{\unr}/K) \to H^2(L^{\unr}/L)</m> translates,
      via the local reciprocity map,
      into a map from <m>\QQ/\ZZ</m> to itself.
      This map turns out to be multiplication by <m>n</m>
      (see <xref ref="bib-Milne-CFT"/>, Proposition II.2.7).

  <subsection>
    <title>The local invariant map</title>
    <p>
    We have now proved the first assertion of <xref ref="P_local_h2"/> (by combining <xref ref="P_H2_upper_bound"/> and <xref ref="P_H2_lower_bound"/>).
    We now turn to the second assertion. In the process, we will also see that <m>H^2(\overline{K}/K) \cong \QQ/\ZZ</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By <xref ref="C_inflation_restriction_h2"/> we have an injection
      <m>H^2(K^{\unr}/K) \to H^2(\overline{K}/K)</m>, and the former is canonically isomorphic to <m>\QQ/\ZZ</m>;
      so we have to prove that this injection is actually also surjective.
      Remember that <m>H^2(\overline{K}/K)</m> is the direct limit of
      <m>H^2(M/K)</m> running over all finite extensions <m>M</m> of <m>K</m>.
      What we just showed above is that if
      <m>[M:K] = n</m> and <m>L</m> is the unramified extension of <m>K</m> of degree <m>n</m>,
      then the images of <m>H^2(M/K)</m> and
      <m>H^2(L/K)</m> in <m>H^2(ML/K)</m> are the same.
      In particular, that means that
      <m>H^2(M/K)</m> is in the image of the map <m>H^2(K^{\unr}/K) \to H^2(\overline{K}/K)</m>.
      Since that's true for any <m>M</m>,
      we get that the map is indeed surjective, hence an isomorphism.
