  <title>The statements of class field theory</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We next give the statements of the principal results of class field theory, with almost no proofs.
      Our goal at this point is to clarify what the statements say and how they can be applied.
      We will have to discuss plenty of other material before returning to the proofs, but the reader who wishes to peek ahead for a glimpse of the strategy
      is directed to <xref ref="sec_look_ahead"/>.
