      Let <m>L/K</m> be a Galois extension of number fields.
      So far, we've used abstract class field theory to construct reciprocity isomorphisms
      and to establish the adelic form of the existence theorem (<xref ref="T_adelic_existence_theorem2"/>).
    </p>
    <p>
      It remains to verify that the <q>abstract</q> reciprocity map coincides with the product of the local reciprocity maps (<xref ref="def-adelic-reciprocity-candidate"/>).
      As noted earlier, this is enough to recover the classical Artin reciprocity law (<xref ref="prop-deduce-Artin"/>); this will finally complete the proof of
      all of the statements originally asserted in <xref ref="ch_statements"/>).

        Let <m>L/K</m> be a Galois extension of number fields. Let
        <me>
          r_{L/K}: I_K \to \Gal(L/K)^{\ab}
        </me> 
        be the product of the local reciprocity maps <xref ref="def-adelic-reciprocity-candidate"/>.
        Meanwhile, let
        <me>
          r'_{L/K}: I_K \to \Gal(L/K)^{\ab}
        </me>
        be the map obtained by inverting the isomorphism <m>\Gal(L/K)^{\ab} \to C_K/\Norm_{L/K} C_L</m> given by <xref ref="T_abstract_adelic_reciprocity"/>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <p>
      As a base case for our work, we need to know that <m>r_{L/K} = r'_{L/K}</m> when <m>L</m> is contained in a small cyclotomic extension.
      Note that this is very similar to the proof that the map <m>v</m> is an abstract henselian valuation (<xref ref="lem-global-abstract-valuation"/>).
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-compare-reciprocity-small-cyclotomic">
      <statement>
        <p>
          With notation as in <xref ref="abstract-local-reciprocity-map"/>, suppose that <m>L \subset K^{\smcy}</m>.
          Then <m>r_{L/K} = r'_{L/K}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          In the setting of abstract class field theory, <m>L/K</m> is viewed as an <q>unramified</q> extension. Consequently,
          the reciprocity map <m>r'_{L/K}: C_K/\Norm_{L/K} C_L \to \Gal(L/K)</m> is described completely by <xref ref="lem-abstract-recip-case1"/>:
          it is given by composing the valuation map <m>v_K: C_K \to \widehat{\ZZ}</m> with the inverse of the map <m>d_K: \Gal(K^{\smcy}/K) \cong \widehat{\ZZ}</m>,
          then projecting from <m>\Gal(K^{\smcy}/K)</m> to <m>\Gal(L/K)</m>. (Note that as per <xref ref="rmk-remove-identification"/>, this does not depend on the 
          artificial choice of the isomorphism <m>d_K</m>, because <m>v_K</m> is defined using the same choice.)
          Consequently, in this case we end up with the usual Artin map for a cyclotomic extension (<xref ref="D_cyclotomic_reciprocity"/>), which is compatible with local reciprocity
          by direct calculation (<xref ref="exa-local-recip-Qp"/>).
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <p>
      For the purposes of illustration, we sketch an alternate approach to that calculation in terms of Lubin-Tate formal groups. 
      This approach has the benefit that it does not depend on global reciprocity, and so can be adapted more easily to extensions which are not cyclotomic.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="L_cyclotomic_explicit_reciprocity">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Via the identifications <m>\Gal(\QQ(\zeta_{p^m})/\QQ)</m> with <m>(\ZZ/p^m\ZZ)^*</m>, we have
          <me>
            r_{\QQ_{\ell}(\zeta_{p^m})/\QQ_{\ell}}(a) = \begin{cases}\sign(a) \amp  \ell = \infty \\ \ell^{v_{\ell}}(a) \amp  \ell \neq \infty, p \\ u^{-1} \amp  \ell = p. \end{cases}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          This is straightforward for <m>\ell = \infty</m>.
          For <m>\ell \neq \infty,
          p</m>, we have an unramified extension of local fields,
          where we know the local reciprocity map takes a uniformizer to a Frobenius.
          In this case the latter is simply <m>\ell</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hard work is in the case <m>\ell=p</m>.
          For that computation one uses what amounts to a very special case of the Lubin-Tate construction of explicit class field theory for local fields,
          using formal groups.
          Put <m>K = \QQ_p</m>,
          <m>\zeta = \zeta_{p^m}</m> and <m>L = \QQ_p(\zeta)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose without loss of generality that <m>u</m> is a positive integer,
          and let <m>\sigma \in \Gal(L/K)</m> be the automorphism corresponding to <m>u^{-1}</m>.
          Since <m>L/K</m> is totally ramified at <m>p</m>,
          we have <m>\Gal(L/K) \cong \Gal(L^{\unr}/K^{\unr})</m>,
          and we can view <m>\sigma</m> as an element of <m>\Gal(L^{\unr}/K)</m>.
          Let <m>\phi_L \in \Gal(L^{\unr}/L)</m> denote the Frobenius,
          and put <m>\tau = \sigma \phi_L</m>.
          Then <m>\tau</m> restricts to the Frobenius in
          <m>\Gal(K^{\unr}/K)</m> and to <m>\sigma</m> in <m>\Gal(L/K)</m>.
          As per <xref ref="def-abstract-recip-candidate"/>,
          we may compute <m>r^{-1}_{L/K}(\sigma)</m> as <m>\Norm_{M/K} \pi_M</m>,
          where <m>M</m> is the fixed field of <m>\tau</m> and <m>\pi_M</m> is a uniformizer.
          We want that norm to be <m>u</m> times a norm from <m>L</m> to <m>K</m>, i.e.,
          <me>
            r^{-1}_{L/K}(\sigma) \in u \Norm_{L/K} L^*
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Define the polynomial
          <me>
            e(x) = x^p + upx
          </me>
          and put
          <me>
            P(x) = e^{(n-1)}(x)^{p-1} + pu
          </me>,
          where <m>e^{(k+1)}(x) = e(e^{(k)}(u))</m>.
          Then <m>P(x)</m> satisfies Eisenstein's criterion,
          so its splitting field over <m>\QQ_p</m> is totally ramified,
          any root of <m>P</m> is a uniformizer,
          and the norm of said uniformizer is <m>(-1)^{[L:K]} pu \in \Norm_{L/K} L^*</m>,
          since <m>\Norm_{L/K}(\zeta-1) = (-1)^{[L:K]}(p)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The punch line is that the splitting field of <m>P(x)</m> is precisely <m>M</m>!
          Here is where the Lubin-Tate construction comes to the rescue... and where I will stop this sketch.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-compare-reciprocity-ramified">
      <statement>
        <p>
          With notation as in <xref ref="abstract-local-reciprocity-map"/>, suppose that <m>L \cap K^{\smcy} = K</m>.
          Then <m>r_{L/K} = r'_{L/K}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          In the setting of abstract class field theory, <m>L/K</m> is viewed as a <q>totally ramified</q> extension. Consequently,
          we may set notation as in the proof of <xref ref="lem-abstract-recip-case2"/>, then apply <xref ref="P_abstract_functorialities"/> to obtain a commutative diagram
          <figure xml:id="fig-connection-4">
          <image width="50%">
          <latex-image>
          \xymatrix{
          C_{M}/\Norm_{N/M} C_{N} \ar^{r'_{N/M}}[r] \ar^{\Norm_{M/K}}[d] &amp; \Gal(N/M) \ar[d] \\
          C_{K}/\Norm_{L/K} C_{L} \ar^{r'_{L/K}}[r] &amp;\Gal(L/K)
          }
          </latex-image>
          </image>
          </figure>
          in which the horizontal arrows are isomorphisms (<xref ref="T_abstract_adelic_reciprocity"/>) and the right vertical arrow is an isomorphism,
          as then is the left vertical arrow.
          We also have a corresponding diagram on the local side:
          <figure xml:id="fig-connection-6">
          <image width="50%">
          <latex-image>
          \xymatrix{
          I_{M} \ar^{r_{N/M}}[r] \ar^{\Norm_{M/K}}[d] &amp; \Gal(N/M) \ar[d] \\
          I_{K} \ar^{r_{L/K}}[r] &amp;\Gal(L/K)
          }
          </latex-image>
          </image>
          </figure>
          This means that we can reduce checking the compatibility for <m>L/K</m> to the corresponding 
          statement for the <q>unramified</q> extension <m>N/M</m>, to which <xref ref="lem-compare-reciprocity-small-cyclotomic"/> applies.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <p>
      At last, we obtain the desired compatibility of reciprocity maps, and with it the completion of the proofs from global class field theory. Hooray!
      (See <xref ref="rmk-local-global-via-brauer"/> for another approach.)
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any Galois extension <m>L/K</m> of number fields, <m>r_{L/K} = r'_{L/K}</m>; that is, the abstract reciprocity map coincides with the product of the local reciprocity maps.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          By the norm limitation theorem (<xref ref="T_adelic_norm_limitation"/>), we may assume that <m>L/K</m> is abelian.
          By <xref ref="P_abstract_functorialities"/>, we may check the comparison of maps after replacing <m>L</m> with a larger abelian extension of <m>K</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may split the exact sequence
          <me>
            1 \to \Gal(K^{\ab}/K^{\smcy}) \to \Gal(K^{\ab}/K) \to \Gal(K^{\smcy}/K) \cong \widehat{\ZZ} \to 1
          </me>
          by choosing an element of <m>\Gal(K^{\ab}/K)</m> lifting the generator <m>1 \in \widehat{\ZZ}</m>. Using this, we can
          split <m>K^{\ab}</m> as the compositum of <m>K^{\smcy}</m> and an abelian extension which is linearly disjoint from <m>K^{\smcy}</m>.
          Using the previous paragraph, we can split some finite extension of <m>L</m> as the compositum of linearly disjoint cyclic extensions,
          one contained in <m>K^{\smcy}</m> and the others linearly disjoint from <m>K^{\smcy}</m>. Applying <xref ref="lem-compare-reciprocity-small-cyclotomic"/> to the first
          extension and <xref ref="lem-compare-reciprocity-ramified"/> to the others, we deduce the desired compatibility for abelian extensions.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        It's worth repeating that only now do we know that the product <m>r_{L/K}</m> of the local reciprocity maps kills principal id&#xe8;les
        (<xref ref="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal"/>). That fact, which relates local behavior for different primes in a highly global fashion,
        is the basis of various <term>higher reciprocity laws</term>.
        See <xref ref="bib-Milne-CFT"/>, Chapter VIII for details.

  <subsection>
    <title>Globalization of local abelian extensions</title>
    <p>
      As a complement to <xref ref="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal2"/>, we show that every local abelian extension is the completion of a global abelian extension.
      Over <m>\QQ</m>, this holds because the local Kronecker-Weber theorem (<xref ref="T_local_Kronecker-Weber2"/>)
      and the Kronecker-Weber theorem (<xref ref="T_Kronecker-Weber"/>) are expressed in terms of the same family of extensions of <m>\QQ</m>, namely the cyclotomic extensions;
      however, in the general case we must take a less explicit approach.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="L_auxiliary_existence">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>K</m> be a number field,
          let <m>v</m> a place of <m>K</m>, and let <m>M</m> a finite abelian extension of <m>K_v</m>.
          Then there exists a finite abelian extension <m>L</m> of <m>K</m> such that for any place <m>w</m> of <m>L</m> above <m>v</m>,
          <m>L_w</m> contains <m>M</m>. (This conclusion can be formally improved; see <xref ref="exer-local-global-existence"/>.)
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We can quickly dispatch the cases where <m>v</m> is infinite:
          if <m>v</m> is complex there is nothing to prove,
          and if <m>v</m> is real then we may take <m>L = K(\sqrt{-1})</m>.
          So assume hereafter that <m>v</m> is finite.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the existence theorem (<xref ref="T_adelic_existence_theorem2"/>)
          plus local-to-global compatibility (<xref ref="prop-reciprocity-trivial-on-diagonal2"/>),
          it suffices to produce an open subgroup <m>V</m> of <m>C_K</m> of finite index such that the preimage of <m>V</m> under
          <m>K_v^* \to C_K</m> is contained in <m>N = \Norm_{M/K_v} M^*</m>.
          Let <m>S</m> be the set of infinite places and let <m>T = S \cup \{v\}</m>.
          By <xref ref="cor-S-units-theorem"/>, <m>\gotho_{K,T}^*</m> is a finitely generated abelian group and
          <m>G = \gotho_{K,T}^* \cap N</m> is a subgroup of <m>\gotho_{K,T}^*</m> of finite index.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pick a finite place <m>u \notin T</m>.
          The image of <m>\gotho_{K,T}^*</m> in <m>K_u^*</m> is a finitely generated subgroup of <m>\gotho_{K_u}^*</m>.
          Hence we can choose a sufficiently small neighborhood <m>U</m> of the identity in <m>\gotho_{K_u}^*</m>
          so as to ensure that <m>U \cap \gotho_{K,T}^* \subseteq G</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now put
          <me>
            W = N \times U \times \prod_{w \in S} K_w^* \times \prod_{w \notin S \cup \{u,v\}} \gotho_K^*, \qquad V = K^* W/K^*.
          </me>
          If <m>\alpha_v \in K_v^*</m> maps into <m>U</m>,
          then there exists <m>\beta \in K^*</m> such that <m>\alpha_v \beta \in W</m>.
          On one hand, this implies that <m>\alpha_v \beta_v \in N</m>.
          On the other hand, it implies that <m>\beta \in \gotho_{K,T}^*</m> and <m>\beta_u \in U</m>,
          so <m>\beta \in G</m> and so <m>\beta_v \in N</m>.
          Thus <m>\alpha_v \in N</m>, as desired.
