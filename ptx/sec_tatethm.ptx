      For <m>L/K</m> a finite extension of local fields (of characteristic <m>0</m>),
      we have now computed that <m>H^1(L/K) = 0</m>
      (<xref ref="L_theorem_90"/>)
      and <m>H^2(L/K)</m> is cyclic of order <m>[L:K]</m>
      (<xref ref="P_local_h2"/>).
      We next use these ingredients to establish all of the statements of local class field theory.

    <title>Tate's theorem</title>
    <p>
      We first prove the theorem of Tate stated earlier
      (<xref ref="T_tate_thm1"/>). Note that right now, we only need this for solvable groups because every finite Galois extension of local fields
      has solvable Galois group (<xref ref="rmk-local-galois-solvable"/>); this allows for some simplification in the arguments. However, we will do the extra work to do the general case
      for later use in the global setting.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_tate_thm2">
      <title>Tate</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> be a finite group and let <m>M</m> be a <m>G</m>-module.
          Suppose that for all subgroups <m>H</m> of <m>G</m>
          (including <m>G</m> itself),
          <m>H^1(H,M)=0</m> and <m>H^2(H,M)</m> is cyclic of order <m>\#H</m>.
          Then there are isomorphisms
          <m>H^i_T(G, \ZZ) \to H^{i+2}_T(G, M)</m> which are canonical up to a choice of generator of <m>H^2(G, M)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>\gamma</m> be a generator of <m>H^2(G, M)</m>.
          Since <m>\Cor \circ \Res = [G:H]</m> (<xref ref="exa-extended-functoriality"/>),
          <m>\Res(\gamma)</m> generates <m>H^2(H,M)</m> for any <m>H</m>.
          We start out by explicitly constructing a <m>G</m>-module containing <m>M</m> in which <m>\gamma</m> becomes a coboundary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Choose a 2-cocycle <m>\phi: G^3 \to M</m> representing <m>\gamma</m>;
          by the definition of a cocycle,
          <md>
            <mrow>\phi(g_0 g, g_1 g, g_2 g) = \phi(g_0, g_1, g_2)^g,</mrow>
            <mrow>\phi(g_1, g_2, g_3) - \phi(g_0, g_2, g_3) + \phi(g_0, g_1, g_3) - \phi(g_0, g_1, g_2) = 0.</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, <m>\phi</m> is a coboundary if and only if it's of the form <m>d(\rho)</m>, that is,
          <m>\phi(g_0, g_1, g_2) = \rho(g_1, g_2) - \rho(g_0, g_2) + \rho(g_0, g_1)</m>.
          This <m>\rho</m> must itself be <m>G</m>-invariant:
          <m>\rho(g_0, g_1)^g = \rho(g_0g, g_1g)</m>.
          Thus <m>\phi</m> is a coboundary if <m>\phi(e, g, hg) = \rho(e,h)^g - \rho(e,hg) + \rho(e,g)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>M[\phi]</m> be the direct sum of <m>M</m> with the free abelian group with one generator <m>x_g</m> for each element <m>g</m> of
          <m>G - \{e\}</m>, with the <m>G</m>-action
          <me>
            x_h^g = x_{hg} - x_g + \phi(e, g, hg)
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          (The symbol <m>x_e</m> should be interpreted as the element
          <m>\phi(e,e,e)</m> of <m>M</m>.) Using the cocycle property of <m>\phi</m>,
          one may verify that this is indeed a <m>G</m>-action;
          by construction, the cocycle <m>\phi</m> becomes zero in
          <m>H^2(G, M[\phi])</m> by setting <m>\rho(e,g) = x_g</m>.
          (Milne calls <m>M[\phi]</m> the <term>splitting module</term> of <m>\phi</m>.)
          Moreover, by the same token, for any <m>H</m>, the restriction of <m>\phi</m> to <m>H</m> also becomes zero in <m>H^2(H, M).</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          The map <m>\alpha: M[\phi] \to \ZZ[G]</m> sending <m>M</m> to zero and <m>x_g</m> to <m>[g]-1</m> is a homomorphism of <m>G</m>-modules.
          Actually it maps into the augmentation ideal <m>I_G</m>,
          and the sequence
          <me>
            0 \to M \to M[\phi] \to I_G \to 0
          </me>
          is exact.
          (Note that this is backwards from the usual exact sequence featuring <m>I_G</m> as a submodule,
          which will appear again momentarily.)
          For any subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>G</m>,
          we can restrict to <m>H</m>-modules,
          then take the long exact sequence:
          <me>
            0 = H^1(H,M) \to H^1(H, M[\phi]) \to H^1(H, I_G) \to H^2(H, M) \to H^2(H, M[\phi]) \to H^2(H, I_G).
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          To make headway with this,
          view <m>0 \to I_G \to \ZZ[G] \to \ZZ \to 0</m> as an exact sequence of <m>H</m>-modules.
          Since <m>\ZZ[G]</m> is induced,
          its Tate groups all vanish.
          So we get a dimension shift:
          <me>
            H^1(H, I_G) \cong H^0_T(H, \ZZ) = \ZZ/(\#H)\ZZ.
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, <m>H^2(H, I_G) \cong H^1(H, \ZZ) = 0</m>.
          Also, the map <m>H^2(H, M) \to H^2(H, M[\phi])</m> is zero because we constructed this map so as to kill off the generator <m>\phi</m>.
          Thus <m>H^2(H, M[\phi]) = 0</m> and <m>H^1(H, I_G) \to H^2(H,M)</m> is surjective.
          But these groups are both finite of the same order!
          So the map is also injective,
          and <m>H^1(H, M[\phi])</m> is also zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now apply <xref ref="L_tate_thm_lemma"/>
          below to conclude that <m>H^i_T(G, M[\phi]) = 0</m> for all <m>i</m>.
          This allows us to use the four-term exact sequence
          <me>
            0 \to M \to M[\phi] \to \ZZ[G] \to \ZZ \to 0
          </me>
          (as in the proof of <xref ref="T_cyclic_group_periodicity"/>) to conclude that <m>H^i_T(G, \ZZ) \cong H^{i+2}_T(G, M)</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <lemma xml:id="L_tate_thm_lemma">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> be a finite group and <m>M</m> a <m>G</m>-module.
          Suppose that <m>H^i(H,M) =0</m> for <m>i=1,2</m> and <m>H</m> any subgroup of <m>G</m>
          (including <m>G</m> itself).
          Then <m>H^i_T(G,M) = 0</m> for all <m>i \in \ZZ</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let us first check that <m>H^i_T(G,M) = 0</m> for all <m>i \geq 0</m>.
          For <m>G</m> cyclic, this follows by periodicity.
          For <m>G</m> solvable, we prove the general result by induction on <m>\#G</m>.
          Since <m>G</m> is solvable,
          it has a proper subgroup <m>H</m> for which <m>G/H</m> is cyclic.
          By the induction hypothesis, <m>H^i_T(H,M) = 0</m> for all <m>i</m>.
          Thus by the inflation-restriction exact sequence (<xref ref="P_inflation_restriction"/>),
          <me>
            0 \to H^i(G/H, M^H) \to H^i(G, M) \to H^i(H, M)
          </me>
          is exact for all <m>i>0</m>.
          The term on the end being zero,
          we have <m>H^i(G/H, M^H) \cong H^i(G,M) = 0</m> for <m>i=1, 2</m>.
          By periodicity
          (<xref ref="T_cyclic_group_periodicity"/>),
          <m>H^i_T(G/H, M^H) = 0</m> for all <m>i</m>,
          so <m>H^i(G/H, M^H) = 0</m> for all <m>i>0</m>,
          and <m>H^i(G,M) = 0</m> for <m>i>0</m>.
          As for <m>i=0</m>, note that <m>H^0_T(G/H, M^H) = H^2(G/H, M^H) = 0</m>,
          so for any <m>x \in M^G</m> there exists <m>y \in M^H</m> such that <m>\Norm_{G/H}(y) = x</m>.
          Since <m>H^0_T(H,M) = 0</m>,
          there exists <m>z \in M</m> such that <m>\Norm_{H}(z) = x</m>.
          Now <m>\Norm_G(z) = \Norm_{G/H} \circ \Norm_H(z) = x</m>.
          Thus <m>H^0_T(G,M) = 0</m>, as desired.
         </p>
        <p>
          We next extend the previous argument from <m>G</m> solvable to <m>G</m> general (this can be skipped if you only want the final result for solvable <m>G</m>).
          For <m>i>0</m>, we already know that the group <m>H^i(G,M)</m> is torsion (<xref ref="exa-extended-functoriality"/>),
          so it suffices to show that its <m>p</m>-primary component vanishes for any prime <m>p</m>.
          To check this, let <m>G_p</m> be any Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m>.
          As per <xref ref="exa-extended-functoriality"/> again,
          the composition of <m>\Res: H^i(G, M) \to H^i(H, M)</m> with <m>\Cor: H^i(H, M) \to H^i(G, M)</m>
          is multiplication by <m>[G:G_p]</m>, which is prime to <m>p</m>. Consequently, <m>\Res</m> induces an injective map on
          <m>p</m>-primary components. Since <m>G_p</m> is solvable, we already know that <m>H^i(G_p, M) = 0</m>, yielding the desired vanishing.
          For <m>i=0</m>, we argue as in <xref ref="rmk-torsion-H0T"/>: we know that <m>H^0_T(G_p, M) = 0</m>, 
          so the map <m>\Norm_{G_p}: M \to M^{G_p}</m> is surjective.
          In particular, for any <m>x \in M^G</m>, we can find <m>y \in M</m> such that <m>x = \sum_{g \in G_p} y^g</m>.
          Then <m>\Norm_G(y) = [G:G_p]x</m>, so the group <m>H^0_T(G, M)</m> is torsion and killed by <m>[G:G_p]</m>; again varying over <m>p</m>
          shows that <m>H^0_T(G, M) = 0</m>.
        </p>
         <p>
          Finally, we treat the case <m>i &lt; 0</m> by dimension shifting.
          Make the exact sequence
          <me>
            0 \to N \to \Ind^G_1 M \to M \to 0
          </me>
          in which <m>m \otimes [g]</m> maps to <m>m^g</m>.
          The term in the middle is acyclic,
          so <m>H^{i+1}_T(H', N) \cong H^{i}_T(H', M)</m> for any subgroup <m>H'</m> of <m>G</m>.
          In particular, <m>H^1(H', N) = H^2(H', N) = 0</m>,
          so the above argument gives <m>H^i_T(G, N) = 0</m> for <m>i\geq 0</m>.
          Now from <m>H^0_T(G, N) = 0</m> we get <m>H^{-1}_T(G, M) = 0</m>;
          since the same argument applies to <m>N</m>,
          we also get <m>H^{-2}_T(G, M) = 0</m> and so on.

    <title>Local reciprocity and norm limitation</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>L/K</m> be a finite Galois extension of local fields.
      For any intermediate extension <m>M/K</m>,
      we know that <m>H^1(L/M) = 0</m> and
      <m>H^2(L/M)</m> is cyclic of order <m>[L:M]</m>.
      We may thus apply <xref ref="T_tate_thm2"/> with <m>G = \Gal(L/K)</m>,
      <m>M = L^*</m> to obtain isomorphisms <m>H^i_T(G, \ZZ) \to H^{i+2}_T(G,M)</m>,
      thus proving <xref ref="T_cup_product_isomorphism"/>.
      This yields a canonical isomorphism
      <me>
        K^*/\Norm_{L/K} L^* = H^0_T(L/K) \to  H^{-2}_T(\Gal(L/K), \ZZ) = \Gal(L/K)^{\ab}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This establishes the existence of the local reciprocity map (<xref ref="T_local_reciprocity"/>),
      keeping in mind that part (a) follows from the explicit computations in <xref ref="sec_localcomp"/>), together with the norm limitation theorem
      (<xref ref="T_norm_limitation"/>),
      modulo one subtlety:
      if <m>M/K</m> is another finite Galois extension containing <m>L</m>,
      we need to know that the diagram
      <figure xml:id="fig-tatethm-1">
        <image>
        <latex-image>
        \xymatrix{
          K^*/\Norm_{M/K} M^* \ar[r] \ar[d]  &amp; \Gal(M/K)^{\ab} \ar[d] \\
          K^*/\Norm_{L/K} L^* \ar[r] &amp; \Gal(L/K)^{\ab}
        }
        </latex-image>
        </image>
      </figure>
      commutes, so that the maps <m>K^* \to \Gal(L/K)^{\ab}</m> fit together to give a map <m>K^* \to \Gal(K^{\sep}/K)^{\ab}</m>.
      In other words, we need a commuting diagram
      <figure xml:id="fig-tatethm-2">
        <image>
        <latex-image>
        \xymatrix{
          H^0_T(\Gal(M/K), M^*)  \ar[r] \ar[d] &amp; H^{-1}_T(\Gal(M/K), I_{\Gal(M/K)}) \ar[d] \ar[r] &amp; H^0_T(\Gal(M/K), \ZZ) \ar[d] \\
           H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), L^*) \ar[r]&amp; H^{-1}_T(\Gal(L/K), I_{\Gal(L/K)}) \ar[r] &amp; H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), \ZZ)
        }
        </latex-image>
        </image>
      </figure>
      The right square in <xref ref="fig-tatethm-2"/> comes from taking long exact sequences in the commutative diagram with exact rows:
      <figure xml:id="fig-tatethm-3">
        <image>
        <latex-image>
        \xymatrix{
          0 \ar[r] &amp; I_{\Gal(M/K)} \ar[r] \ar[d] &amp; \ZZ[\Gal(M/K)] \ar[r] \ar[d] &amp; \ZZ \ar[r] \ar[d] &amp; 0 \\
          0 \ar[r] &amp; I_{\Gal(L/K)} \ar[r] &amp; \ZZ[\Gal(L/K)] \ar[r] &amp; \ZZ \ar[r] &amp; 0
        }
        </latex-image>
        </image>
      </figure>
      To construct the left square in <xref ref="fig-tatethm-2"/>, we similarly need to construct a commutative diagram with exact rows:
      <figure xml:id="fig-tatethm-4">
        <image>
        <latex-image>
        \xymatrix{
          0 \ar[r] &amp; M^* \ar[r] \ar^{\Norm_{M/L}}[d] &amp; M^*[\phi_M] \ar[r] \ar[d] &amp; I_{\Gal(M/K)} \ar[r] \ar[d] &amp; 0 \\
          0 \ar[r] &amp; L^* \ar[r] &amp; L^*[\phi_L] \ar[r] &amp; I_{\Gal(L/K)} \ar[r] &amp; 0
        }
        </latex-image>
        </image>
      </figure>
      I claim we can arrange for this as follows. First choose a cocycle <m>\phi_M: \Gal(M/K)^3 \to M^*</m> representing the preferred generator of <m>H^2(M/K)</m>.
      Then there exists a unique map <m>\phi_L</m> fitting into the following commuting square:
      <figure xml:id="fig-tatethm-5">
        <image>
        <latex-image>
        \xymatrix{
          \Gal(M/K)^3 \ar^(.7){\phi_M}[r] \ar[d] &amp; M^* \ar^{\Norm_{M/L}}[d] \\
          \Gal(L/K)^3 \ar^(.7){\phi_L}[r] &amp; L^*
        }
        </latex-image>
        </image>
      </figure>
      and this will necessarily give a cocycle representing the preferred generator of <m>H^2(L/K)</m>. Further details omitted.

    <title>The local existence theorem</title>
    <p>
      It remains to prove the local existence theorem (<xref ref="T_local_existence"/>). This does not follow directly from cohomological considerations;
      instead we need to construct some extensions with small norm groups. Fortunately, since we have already established the norm limitation theorem,
      we do not need to construct <em>abelian</em> extensions; this will give us some flexibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      We begin with a lemma,
      in which we take advantage of Kummer theory to establish a special case of the existence theorem.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="L_hilbert_symbol">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\ell</m> be a prime number.
          Let <m>K</m> be a local field containing a primitive <m>\ell</m>-th root of unity.
          Then <m>x \in K^*</m> is an <m>\ell</m>-th power in <m>K</m> if and only if belongs to
          <m>\Norm_{L/K} L^*</m> for every cyclic extension <m>L</m> of <m>K</m> of degree <m>\ell</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>M</m> be the compositum of all cyclic <m>\ell</m>-extensions of <m>K</m>.
          The group <m>K^*/(K^*)^{\ell}</m> is finite (<xref ref="exer-finite-power-quotient"/>),
          and hence is isomorphic to <m>(\ZZ/\ell \ZZ)^n</m> for some positive integer <m>n</m>.
          By Kummer theory (<xref ref="T_Kummer_reformulated"/>), we also have <m>\Gal(M/K) \cong (\ZZ/\ell \ZZ)^n</m>.
          By the local reciprocity law (<xref ref="T_local_reciprocity"/>), <m>K^*/\Norm_{M/K}M^* \cong (\ZZ/\ell \ZZ)^n</m>;
          consequently, on one hand <m>(K^*)^{\ell} \subseteq \Norm_{M/K}M^*</m>,
          and on other hand these subgroups of <m>K^*</m> have the same index <m>\ell^n</m>.
          They are thus equal, proving the claim.

      This allows to deduce a corollary of the existence theorem which is needed in its proof.

        <p>
          Let <m>K</m> be a local field of characteristic <m>0</m>.
          Then the intersection of the groups <m>\Norm_{L/K} L^*</m> for all finite extensions <m>L</m> of <m>K</m> is the trivial group.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>D_K</m> be the intersection in question;
          note that <m>D_K \subseteq \gotho_K^*</m> by considering unramified extensions of <m>K</m>,
          so <m>D_K</m> is in particular a compact topological group.
          By <xref ref="L_hilbert_symbol"/>,
          every element of <m>D_K</m> is an <m>\ell</m>-th power in <m>K</m> for every prime <m>\ell</m>.
          We will show that in fact every element of <m>D_K</m> is the <m>\ell</m>-th power of an element of <m>D_K</m> itself;
          this will show that <m>D_K</m> is a divisible abelian group, and in particular every element is an <m>n</m>-th power for every positive integer <m>n</m>.
          This will then imply using <xref ref="exer-finite-power-intersection"/> that <m>D_K</m> is the trivial group.
          (Alternatively, one can follow the suggestion of <xref ref="rmk-Hilbert-symbol"/> and prove that the conclusion of <xref ref="L_hilbert_symbol"/>
          retains true when <m>\ell</m> is replaced by an arbitrary positive integer <m>n</m>, and then apply <xref ref="exer-finite-power-intersection"/> directly.)

        <p>
          We first need to verify something which might seem obvious but isn't quite: for <m>L/K</m> a finite extension, 
          <me>\Norm_{L/K} D_L = D_K</me>.
          This isn't obvious because for <m>x \in D_K</m>, for each 
          individual finite extension <m>M</m> of <m>K</m> we can write <m>x = \Norm_{M/K}(z)</m> for some <m>z \in M^*</m>, but it is not apparent that we can force the elements
          <m>y = \Norm_{M/L}(z)</m> to all be equal. It is nonetheless true because, for any given <m>M</m> the set of such <m>y</m> is a nonempty compact subset of <m>U_L</m>, and any finite
          intersection of these subsets is nonempty (because we can pass to a large enough field to contain all of the <m>M</m> in question and bring an element from there);
          so the whole intersection is nonempty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let <m>\ell</m> be a prime and choose <m>x \in D_K</m>. For each finite extension <m>L</m> of <m>K</m> containing a primitive <m>\ell</m>-th root of unity,
          let <m>E(L)</m> be the set of <m>\ell</m>-th roots of <m>x</m> in <m>K</m> which belong to <m>\Norm_{L/K} L^*</m>. This set is finite (of cardinality at most <m>\ell</m>)
          and nonempty: we have <m>x = \Norm_{L/K}(y)</m> for some <m>y \in D_L</m> by the previous paragraph, so <m>y</m> has an <m>\ell</m>-th root <m>z</m> in <m>L</m> and
          <m>\Norm_{L/K}(z) \in E(L)</m>. By the previous paragraph, <m>E(M) \subseteq E(L)</m> whenever <m>L \subseteq M</m>, so we may again conclude using the finite intersection
          property. Alternatively, just note that if each of the (finitely many!) elements of <m>E(K)</m> fails to survive to some larger field, we can take a compositum to get
          a single field <m>L</m> such that no element of <m>E(K)</m> belongs to <m>E(L)</m>, which is absurd since <m>E(L) \neq \emptyset</m>.

      We now return to the proof of the local existence theorem (<xref ref="T_local_existence"/>).

    <theorem xml:id="T_local_existence2">
      <title>Local existence theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For every (open) subgroup <m>U</m> of <m>K^*</m> of finite index,
          there exists a finite abelian extension <m>L</m> of <m>K</m> such that <m>U = \Norm_{L/K} L^*</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We note first that by the local reciprocity law (<xref ref="T_local_reciprocity"/>),
          it is enough to construct <m>L</m> so that <m>U</m> contains <m>\Norm_{L/K}L^*</m>:
          in this case,
          we will have <m>\Gal(L/K) \cong K^*/\Norm_{L/K}L^*</m>,
          and then <m>U/\Norm_{L/K}L^*</m> will corresponding to
          <m>\Gal(L/M)</m> for some intermediate extension <m>M/K</m> having the desired effect.
          We note next that by the norm limitation theorem (<xref ref="T_norm_limitation"/>),
          it suffices to produce <em>any</em>
          finite extension <m>L/K</m>,
          not necessarily abelian, such that <m>U</m> contains <m>\Norm_{L/K}L^*</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>m\ZZ \subseteq \ZZ</m> be the image of <m>U</m> in <m>K^*/\gotho_K^* \cong \ZZ</m>;
          by choosing <m>L</m> to contain the unramified extension of <m>K</m> of degree <m>m</m>,
          we may ensure that the image of
          <m>\Norm_{L/K} L^*</m> in <m>K^*/\gotho_K^*</m> is also contained in <m>m\ZZ</m>.
          It thus remains to further ensure that
          <me>
            (\Norm_{L/K} L^*) \cap \gotho_K^* \subseteq U \cap \gotho_K^*.
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>\gotho_K^*</m> is compact,
          each open subgroup <m>(\Norm_{L/K}L^*) \cap \gotho_K^*</m> is also closed and hence compact.
          By <xref ref="C_universal_norms_divisible"/>,
          as <m>L/K</m> runs over all finite extensions of <m>K</m>,
          the intersection of the groups <m>(\Norm_{L/K} L^*) \cap \gotho_K^*</m> is trivial;
          in particular, the intersection of the compact subsets
          <me>
            ((\Norm_{L/K} L^*) \cap \gotho_K^*) \cap (\gotho_K^* \setminus U)
          </me>
          of <m>\gotho_K^*</m> is empty.
          By the finite intersection property
          (and taking a compositum),
          there exists a single <m>L/K</m> for which <m>(\Norm_{L/K} L^*) \cap \gotho_K^* \subseteq U \cap \gotho_K^*</m>, as desired.
