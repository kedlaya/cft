    <title>The local reciprocity law</title>
    <p>
      The main theorem of local class field theory is the following.
    </p>
    <definition>
    <p>
      For <m>K</m> a local field,
      let <m>K^{\ab}</m> be the maximal abelian extension of <m>K</m>.
    </p>
    </definition>
    <theorem xml:id="T_local_reciprocity">
      <title>Local Reciprocity Law</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>K</m> be a local field.
          Then there is a unique map
          <m>\phi_K: K^* \to \Gal(K^{\ab}/K)</m> satisfying the following conditions:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                for any uniformizer <m>\pi</m> of <m>K</m> and any finite unramified extension <m>L</m> of <m>K</m>,
                <m>\phi_K(\pi)</m> acts on <m>L</m> as the Frobenius automorphism;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                for any finite abelian extension <m>L</m> of <m>K</m>,
                the group of norms <m>\Norm_{L/K} L^*</m> is in the kernel of <m>\phi_K</m>,
                and the induced map <m>K^*/\Norm_{L/K} L^* \to \Gal(L/K)</m> is an isomorphism.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <definition>
    <p>
      The map <m>\phi_K</m> in <xref ref="T_local_reciprocity"/> is variously called the
      <term>local reciprocity map</term>
      or the <term>norm residue symbol</term>.
    </p>
    </definition>
    <example xml:id="exa-local-recip-Qp">
    <p>
      Using the local Kronecker-Weber theorem
      (<xref ref="T_local_Kronecker-Weber1">Theorem</xref>),
      the statement of <xref ref="T_local_reciprocity"/> can be explicitly verified for <m>K=\QQ_p</m>.
      To wit, we have <m>K^{\ab} = K_1 K_2</m> where <m>K_1 = \bigcup_n \QQ_p(\zeta_{p^n})</m>
      and <m>K_2 = \bigcup_n \QQ_p(\zeta_{p^n-1})</m>, and <m>\Gal(K^{\ab}/K) \cong \Gal(K_1/K) \times \Gal(K_2/K)</m>.
      Since <m>p</m> is totally ramified in <m>K_1</m>, we have 
      <me>\Gal(K_1/K) \cong \Gal(\left(\bigcup_n \QQ(\zeta_{p^n})\right)/\QQ) \cong \ZZ_p^*.
      </me>
      Since <m>p</m> is unramified in <m>K_2</m>, we have
      <me>
      \Gal(K_2/K) \cong \Gal(\overline{\FF}_p/\FF_p) \cong \widehat{\ZZ}.
      </me>
      However, it will be more convenient to think of the image as sitting inside
      <me>
      \Gal(\QQ^{\ab}/\QQ) \cong \widehat{\ZZ}^* \cong \ZZ_p^* \times \prod_{q \neq p} \ZZ_q^*
      </me>
      (here using global Kronecker-Weber and Artin reciprocity).
      The factor <m>\Gal(K_2/K) \cong \widehat{\ZZ}</m> maps to <m>\prod_{q \neq p} \ZZ_q^*</m> via
      <m>e \mapsto p^e</m>, noting that this makes sense in the target.
      For the rest, see <xref ref="exer-Qp-reciprocity-map"/>.
    </p>
    </example>
    <p>
      The local reciprocity law is an analogue of the Artin reprocity law for number fields.
      We also get an analogue of the existence of ray class fields.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_local_existence">
      <title>Local existence theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For every finite
          (not necessarily abelian)
          extension <m>L</m> of <m>K</m>,
          <m>\Norm_{L/K} L^*</m> is an open subgroup of <m>K^*</m> of finite index.
          Conversely, for every (open) subgroup <m>U</m> of <m>K^*</m> of finite index,
          there exists a finite abelian extension <m>L</m> of <m>K</m> such that <m>U = \Norm_{L/K} L^*</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
     <proof>
       <p>
         For the first assertion, see <xref ref="exer-norm-subgroup-is-open"/> 
         (or <xref ref="exer-norm-subgroup-is-open-charp"/> for the case of characteristic <m>p</m>).
         For the second assertion, see <xref ref="T_local_existence2"/>.
       </p>
     </proof>
   </theorem>
    <remark xml:id="rem-subspace-topology">
    <p>
      In <xref ref="T_local_existence"/>, the topology on <m>K^*</m> is the one given by taking the disjoint union of the sets
      <m>\pi^n \gotho_K^*</m> for <m>n \in \ZZ</m>, where <m>\pi \in K^\times</m> is a uniformizer. 
      In fact, it is only necessary to keep track of this topology in the function field case;
      for <m>K</m> a finite extension of <m>\QQ_p</m>, one can show that every subgroup of <m>K^*</m> of finite index is open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way to identify the correct topology on <m>K^*</m> is to equip <m>K</m> with its usual topology (the norm topology defined by an extension of
      the <m>p</m>-adic absolute value) and then take the subspace topology for the inclusion of <m>K^*</m> into <m>K \times K</m> given by
      <m>x \mapsto (x, x^{-1})</m>. While this does coincide with the subspace topology for the inclusion of <m>K^*</m> into <m>K</m>, there are good reasons
      not to view it this way; see <xref ref="exer-subspace-top"/>.
    </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      The local existence theorem says that if we start with a nonabelian extension <m>L</m>,
      then <m>\Norm_{L/K} L^*</m> is also the group of norms of an abelian extension.
      But which one? The following theorem gives the answer.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_norm_limitation">
      <title>Norm limitation theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>M</m> be the maximal abelian subextension of <m>L/K</m>.
          Then <m>\Norm_{L/K} L^* = \Norm_{M/K} M^*</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <remark>
    <p>
    In <xref ref="T_norm_limitation"/>, it is evident that <m>\Norm_{L/K} L^* \subseteq \Norm_{M/K} M^*</m> because
    <m>\Norm_{L/K} = \Norm_{M/K} \circ \Norm_{L/M}</m>. Since the group <m>\Norm_{L/K} L^*</m> can be shown directly to be an open subgroup of finite index 
    (see <xref ref="exer-norm-subgroup-is-open"/>), <xref ref="T_local_existence"/> implies that it has the form <m>\Norm_{N/K} N^*</m> for some finite abelian 
    extension <m>N</m> of <m>K</m>. <xref ref="T_local_reciprocity"/> then implies that <m>M \subseteq N</m>. The subtle point that remains to be proven is that
    the inclusion <m>M \subseteq N</m> is actually an equality.
    </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
    <p>
      For each uniformizer <m>\pi</m> of <m>K</m>,
      let <m>K_\pi</m> be the composite of all finite abelian extensions <m>L</m> such that <m>\pi \in \Norm_{L/K} L^*</m>.
      Then the local reciprocity map implies that <m>K^{\ab} = K_\pi \cdot K^{\unr}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It turns out that <m>K_\pi</m> can be explicitly constructed as the extension of <m>K</m> by certain elements,
      thus giving a generalization of local Kronecker-Weber to arbitrary local fields!
      These elements come from <term>Lubin-Tate formal groups</term>,
      which we will not discuss further.
    </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      Note that for <m>L/K</m> a finite extension of local fields, the map
      <me>
        K^*/\Norm_{L/K} L^* \to \Gal(L/K) = G
      </me>
      obtained by combining the local reciprocity law with the norm limitation theorem is in fact an isomorphism of
      <m>G = G^{\ab} = H^{-2}_T(G, \ZZ)</m> with <m>K^*/\Norm_{L/K} L^* = H^0_T(G, L^*)</m>.
      We will in fact show something stronger,
      from which we will deduce both the local reciprocity law and the norm limitation theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_cup_product_isomorphism">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any finite Galois extension <m>L/K</m> of local fields with Galois group <m>G</m>,
          there is a canonical isomorphism <m>H^i_T(G, \ZZ) \to H^{i+2}_T(G, L^*)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <remark>
      <p>
        The map in <xref ref="T_cup_product_isomorphism"/> can be written in terms of the <term>cup product</term> in group cohomology.
        However, we will not develop this point of view here.
      </p>
    </remark>

  <subsection>
    <title>The local invariant map</title>
    <p>
      We will first prove the following.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_Brauer_group_identification">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any local field <m>K</m>,
          there exist canonical isomorphisms
          <md>
            <mrow>H^2(\Gal(K^{\unr}/K), (K^{\unr})^*) \to H^2(\Gal(\overline{K}/K), \overline{K}^*)</mrow>
            <mrow>\inv_K: H^2(\Gal(\overline{K}/K), \overline{K}^*) \to \QQ/\ZZ.</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      The first map is an inflation homomorphism;
      the second map in this theorem is called the
      <term>local invariant map</term>.
      More precisely,
      for <m>L/K</m> finite of degree <m>n</m>, we have an isomorphism
      <me>
        \inv_{L/K}: H^2(\Gal(L/K), L^*) \to \frac{1}{n}\ZZ/\ZZ
      </me>,
      and these isomorphisms are compatible with inflation.
      (In particular,
      we don't need to prove the first isomorphism separately.
      But that can be done, by considerations involving the Brauer group;
      see below.)
    </p>
    <p>
      To use this to prove <xref ref="T_cup_product_isomorphism"/>
      and hence the local reciprocity law (<xref ref="T_local_reciprocity"/>) and the norm limitation theorem (<xref ref="T_norm_limitation"/>),
      we employ the following theorem of Tate,
      which we will prove a bit later
      (see <xref ref="T_tate_thm2"/>).
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_tate_thm1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> be a finite group and <m>M</m> a <m>G</m>-module.
          Suppose that for each subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>G</m>
          (including <m>H=G</m>),
          <m>H^1(H,M) = 0</m> and <m>H^2(H,M)</m> is cyclic of order <m>\#H</m>.
          Then there exist isomorphisms <m>H^i_T(G, \ZZ) \to H^{i+2}_T(G, M)</m> for all <m>i</m>;
          these are canonical once you fix a choice of a generator of <m>H^2(G,M)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <remark>
    <p>
      In general, for any field <m>K</m>,
      the group <m>H^2(\Gal(\overline{K}/K), \overline{K}^*)</m> is called the
      <term>Brauer group</term> of <m>K</m>.
      It is an important invariant of <m>K</m>;
      it can be realized also in terms of certain noncommutative algebras over <m>K</m>
      (central simple algebras).
      I won't pursue this connection further,
      nor study many of the interesting properties and applications of Brauer groups.

  <subsection>
    <title>Abstract class field theory</title>
    <p>
      Having derived local class field theory once,
      we will do it again a slightly different way in <xref ref="ch_abstract"/>.
      In the course of proving the above results,
      we will show (among other things) that if <m>L/K</m> is a cyclic extension of local fields,
      <me>
        \#H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), L^*) = [L:K], \qquad \#H^{-1}_T(\Gal(L/K), L^*) =1.
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      It turns out that this alone is enough number-theoretic input to prove local class field theory!
      More precisely,
      we will identify <q>minimal</q> properties of a field <m>K</m> with <m>G = \Gal(\overline{K}/K)</m>,
      a surjective continuous homomorphism <m>d: G \to \widehat{\ZZ}</m> (defining <q>unramified</q> extensions of <m>K</m>),
      a continuous <m>G</m>-module <m>A</m> (playing the role of <m>\overline{K}^*</m>),
      and a homomorphism <m>v: A^G \to \widehat{\ZZ}</m> (playing the role of the valuation map)
      that will suffice to yield the reciprocity map. See <xref ref="sec_look_ahead"/> for the continuation of this discussion.
