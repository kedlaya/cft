      In the previous chapter,
      we associated to a finite group <m>G</m> and a (right) <m>G</m>-module <m>M</m> a sequence of abelian groups <m>H^i(G, M)</m>,
      called the cohomology groups of <m>M</m>.
      (They're also called the <em>Galois cohomology</em>
      groups because in number theory,
      <m>G</m> will invariably be the Galois group of some extension of number fields,
      and <m>A</m> will be some object manufactured from this extension.)
      What we didn't do is make the construction at all usable in practice!
      This time we will remedy this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall the last point
      (and the last exercise)
      from the last chapter: if
      <me>
        0 \to M \to M_0 \to M_1 \to \cdots
      </me>
      is an acyclic resolution of <m>M</m> (i.e., the sequence is exact,
      and <m>H^i(G, M_j) = 0</m> for <m>i > 0</m> and all <m>j</m>), then
      <me>
        H^i(G, M) = \ker(M_i^G \to M_{i+1}^G)/\im(M_{i-1}^G \to M_i^G)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus to compute cohomology,
      we are going to need an ample supply of acyclic <m>G</m>-modules.
      We will get these using a process known as <em>induction</em>.
      By way of motivation,
      we note first that if <m>G</m> is the trivial group,
      <em>every</em> <m>G</m>-module is acyclic:
      if <m>0 \to M \to I_0 \to I_1 \cdots</m> is an injective resolution,
      taking <m>G</m>-invariants has no effect,
      so <m>0 \to I_0 \to I_1 \to \cdots</m> is still exact except at <m>I_0</m>
      (where we omitted <m>M</m>).
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> and <m>M</m> is an <m>H</m>-module,
      we define the <em>induced</em> <m>G</m>-module associated to <m>M</m> to be <m>\Ind^G_H M = M \otimes_{\ZZ[H]} \ZZ[G]</m>.
      We may also identify <m>\Ind^G_H M</m> with the set of functions
      <m>\phi: G \to M</m> such that <m>\phi(gh) = \phi(g)^h</m> for <m>h \in H</m>,
      with the <m>G</m>-action on the latter being given by <m>\phi^g(g') = \phi(gg')</m>:
      namely, the element <m>m \otimes [g] \in M \otimes_{\ZZ[H]} \ZZ[G]</m> corresponds to the function
      <m>\phi_{m,g}</m> taking <m>g'</m> to <m>m^{gg'}</m> if <m>gg' \in H</m> and to 0 otherwise.

    <lemma xml:id="L_Shapiro">
      <title>Shapiro's lemma</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> and <m>N</m> is an <m>H</m>-module,
          then there is a canonical isomorphism <m>H^i(G, \Ind^G_H N) \to H^i(H, N)</m>.
          In particular,
          <m>N</m> is an acyclic <m>H</m>-module if and only if
          <m>\Ind^G_H(N)</m> is an acyclic <m>G</m>-module.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        The key points are:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>(\Ind^G_H N)^G = N^H</m>,
              so there is an isomorphism for <m>i=0</m> (this is clearest from the description using functions);
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              the functor <m>\Ind^G_H</m> from <m>H</m>-modules to <m>G</m>-modules is exact (that is,
              <m>\ZZ[G]</m> is flat over <m>\ZZ[H]</m>,
              which is easy to see because it in fact is free over <m>\ZZ[H]</m>);
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              if <m>I</m> is an injective <m>H</m>-module,
              then <m>\Ind^G_H(I)</m> is an injective <m>G</m>-module.
              This follows from the existence of a canonical isomorphism <m>\Hom_G(M, \Ind^G_H I) = \Hom_H(M, I)</m>,
              for which see <xref ref="P_adjoint_property">Proposition</xref> below.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now take an injective resolution of <m>N</m>,
        apply <m>\Ind^G_H</m> to it,
        and the result is an injective resolution of <m>\Ind^G_H N</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      We say <m>M</m> is an <em>induced</em>
      <m>G</m>-module if it has the form
      <m>\Ind^G_{1} N</m> for some abelian group <m>N</m>,
      i.e., it can be written as <m>N \otimes_\ZZ \ZZ[G]</m>.
      (The subscript 1 stands for the trivial group,
      since <m>G</m>-modules for <m>G = 1</m> are just abelian groups.)
    </p>
    <corollary xml:id="C_induced_acyclic">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>M</m> is an induced <m>G</m>-module, then <m>M</m> is acyclic.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </corollary>
    <p>
      To complete the previous argument,
      we need an important property of induced modules.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="P_adjoint_property">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>H</m> be a subgroup of <m>G</m>,
          let <m>M</m> be a <m>G</m>-module,
          and let <m>N</m> be an <m>H</m>-module.
          Then there are natural isomorphisms
          <md>
            <mrow>\Hom_G(M, \Ind^G_H N) \amp \cong \Hom_H(M, N)</mrow>
            <mrow>\Hom_G(\Ind^G_H N, M) \amp \cong \Hom_H(N,M).</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      In other words,
      the restriction functor from <m>G</m>-modules to <m>H</m>-modules and the induction functor from <m>H</m>-modules to <m>G</m>-modules form a pair of
      <em>adjoint functors</em> in both directions.
      This is rather unusual;
      it is far more common to have such a relationship in only one direction.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        To begin with, note that if we take <m>N = M</m>
        (or more precisely,
        <m>N</m> is a copy of <m>M</m> with only the action of <m>H</m> retained),
        then the identity map between <m>M</m> and <m>N</m> is supposed to correspond both to a homomorphism
        <m>M \to \Ind^G_H M</m> and to a homomorphism <m>\Ind^G_H M \to M</m>.
        Let us write these maps down first:
        the map <m>\Ind^G_H M \to M</m> is
        <me>
          \sum_{g \in G} m_g \otimes [g] \mapsto \sum_{g \in G} (m_g)^g
        </me>,
        while the map <m>M \to \Ind^G_H M</m> is
        <me>
          m \mapsto \sum_i m^{g_i} \otimes [g_i^{-1}]
        </me>
        where <m>g_i</m> runs over a set of left coset representatives of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m>.
        Note that this second map doesn't depend on the choice of the representatives;
        for <m>g \in G</m>,
        we can use the coset representatives <m>gg_i</m> instead,
        so the equality
        <me>
          m^{g} \mapsto \sum_{i} m^{gg_i} \otimes [g_i^{-1}] = \left( \sum_{i} m^{gg_i} \otimes [(g g_i)^{-1}] \right)[g]
        </me>
        means that we do in fact get a map compatible with the <m>G</m>-actions.
        (Note that the composition of these two maps is not the identity!
        For more on this point,
        see the discussion of extended functoriality in <xref ref="sec_homology">Chapter</xref>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let <m>N</m> be general.
        Given a homomorphism <m>M \to N</m> of <m>H</m>-modules,
        we get a corresponding homomorphism <m>\Ind^G_H M \to \Ind^G_H N</m> of <m>G</m>-modules,
        which we can then compose with the above map
        <m>M \to \Ind^G_H M</m> to get a homomorphism <m>M \to \Ind^G_H N</m> of <m>G</m>-modules.
        We thus get a map
        <me>
          \Hom_H(M,N) \to \Hom_G(M, \Ind^G_H N);
        </me>
        to get the map in the other direction,
        start with a homomorphism <m>M \to \Ind^G_H N</m>,
        identify the target with functions <m>\phi: G \to N</m>,
        then compose with the map <m>\Ind^G_H N \to N</m> taking <m>\phi</m> to <m>\phi(e)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the other direction,
        given a homomorphism <m>N \to M</m> of <m>H</m>-modules,
        we get a corresponding homomorphism <m>\Ind^G_H N \to \Ind^G_H M</m> of <m>G</m>-modules,
        which we can then compose with the above map
        <m>\Ind^G_H M \to M</m> to get a homomorphism <m>\Ind^G_H N \to M</m> of <m>G</m>-modules.
        We thus get a map
        <me>
          \Hom_H(N,M) \to \Hom_G(\Ind^G_H N,M);
        </me>
        to get the map in the other direction,
        start with a homomorphism <m>\Ind^G_H N \to M</m> of <m>G</m>-modules and evaluate it on
        <m>n \otimes [e]</m> to get a homomorphism <m>N \to M</m> of <m>H</m>-modules.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      The point of all of this is that it is much easier to embed <m>M</m> into an acyclic <m>G</m>-module than into an injective <m>G</m>-module:
      use the map <m>M \to \Ind^G_1 M</m> constructed in <xref ref="P_adjoint_property">Proposition</xref>!
      Immediate consequence: if <m>M</m> is finite,
      it can be embedded into a finite acyclic <m>G</m>-module,
      and thus <m>H^i(G,M)</m> is finite for all <m>i</m>. (But contrary to what you might expect,
      for fixed <m>M</m>,
      the groups <m>H^i(G,M)</m> do not necessarily become zero for <m>i</m> large,
      even if <m>M</m> is finite!
      We'll see explicit examples next time.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Another consequence is the following result.
      (The case <m>i=1</m> was an exercise earlier.)
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_additive_theorem_90">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L/K</m> be a finite Galois extension of fields.
          Then
          <me>
            H^i(\Gal(L/K), L) = 0 \mbox{ for all \(i>0\).}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Put <m>G = \Gal(L/K)</m>.
        The normal basis theorem
        (see Lang, <em>Algebra</em> or Milne, Lemma II.1.24)
        states that there exists <m>\alpha \in L</m> whose conjugates form a basis of <m>L</m> as a <m>K</m>-vector space.
        This implies that <m>L \cong \Ind^{G}_{1} K</m>,
        so <m>L</m> is an induced <m>G</m>-module and so is acyclic.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Now let's see an explicit way to compute group cohomology.
      Given a group <m>G</m> and a <m>G</m>-module <m>M</m>,
      define the <m>G</m>-modules <m>N_i</m> for
      <m>i \geq 0</m> as the set of functions
      <m>\phi: G^{i+1} \to M</m>, with the <m>G</m>-action
      <me>
        (\phi^g)(g_0, \dots, g_i) = \phi(g_0g^{-1}, \dots, g_ig^{-1})^g
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that this module is induced:
      we have <m>N_i = \Ind_{1}^G N_{i,0}</m> where <m>N_{i,0}</m> is the subset of <m>N_i</m> consisting of functions for which
      <m>\phi(g_0, \dots,
      g_i) = 0</m> when <m>g_0 \neq e</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Define the map <m>d_i: N_i \to N_{i+1}</m> by
      <me>
        (d_i \phi)(g_0, \dots, g_{i+1}) = \sum_{j=0}^{i+1} (-1)^j \phi(g_0, \dots, \widehat{g_j}, \dots, g_{i+1})
      </me>,
      where the hat over <m>g_j</m> means you omit it from the list.
      Then one checks that the sequence
      <me>
        0 \to M \to N_0 \to N_1 \to \dots
      </me>
      is exact.
      Since the <m>N_i</m> are induced,
      this is an acyclic resolution:
      thus the cohomology of the complex
      <me>
        0 \to N_0^G \to N_1^G \to \cdots
      </me>
      coincides with the cohomology groups <m>H^i(G, M)</m>.
      And now we have something we can actually compute! (Terminology:
      the elements of <m>N_i^G</m> in the kernel of <m>d_i</m> are called
      <em>(homogeneous) <m>i</m>-cochains</em>;
      the ones in the image of <m>d_{i-1}</m> are called
      <em><m>i</m>-coboundaries</em>.)
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>Fun with <m>H^1</m></title>
    <p>
      For example,
      we can give a very simple description of <m>H^1(G,M)</m>.
      Namely, a 1-cochain <m>\phi: G^2 \to M</m> is determined by <m>\rho(g) = \phi(e, g)</m>,
      which by <m>G</m>-invariance satisfies the relation
      <md>
        <mrow>0 \amp = (d_1\phi)(e, h, gh)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \phi(h, gh) - \phi(e, gh) + \phi(e, h)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = (\phi^h)(h,gh) - \rho(gh) + \rho(h)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \phi(e, g)^h - \rho(gh) + \rho(h)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \rho(g)^h + \rho(h) - \rho(gh).</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the coboundary of a 0-cochain <m>\psi: G \to M</m> if and only if
      <me>
        \rho(g) = \phi(e,g) = \psi(g) - \psi(e) = \psi(e)^g - \psi(e)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is, <m>H^1(G,M)</m> consists of crossed homomorphisms modulo principal crossed homomorphisms,
      consistent with the definition we gave in <xref ref="sec_Kummer_theory">Chapter</xref>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may also interpret <m>H^1(G,M)</m> as the set of isomorphism classes of
      <em>principal homogeneous spaces</em> of <m>M</m>.
      Such objects are sets <m>A</m> with both a <m>G</m>-action and an <m>M</m>-action,
      subject to the following restrictions:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            for any <m>a \in A</m>,
            the map <m>M \to A</m> given by <m>m \mapsto m(a)</m> is a bijection;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            for <m>a \in A</m>, <m>g \in G</m> and <m>m \in M</m>,
            <m>m(a)^g = m^g(a)</m> (i.e., the <m>G</m>-action and <m>M</m>-action commute).
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      To define the associated class in
      <m>H^1(G,M)</m>, pick any <m>a \in A</m>,
      take the map <m>\rho: G \to M</m> given by <m>\rho(g) = a^g - a</m>,
      and let <m>\phi</m> be the 1-cocycle with <m>\phi(e, g) = \rho(g)</m>.
      The verification that this defines a bijection is left to the reader. (For example,
      the identity in <m>H^1(G,M)</m> corresponds to the trivial principal homogeneous space <m>A=M</m>,
      on which <m>G</m> acts as it does on <m>M</m> while <m>M</m> acts by translation:
      <m>m(a) = m+a</m>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      This interpretation of <m>H^1</m> appears prominently in the theory of elliptic curves: For example,
      if <m>L</m> is a finite extension of <m>K</m> and <m>E</m> is an elliptic curve over <m>E</m>,
      then <m>H^1(\Gal(L/K), E(\overline{K}))</m> is the set of <m>K</m>-isomorphism classes of curves whose Jacobians are <m>K</m>-isomorphic to <m>E</m>
      (but which might not themselves be isomorphic to <m>E</m> by virtue of not having a <m>K</m>-rational point).
      For another example,
      <m>H^1(\Gal(L/K), \Aut(E))</m> parametrizes twists of <m>E</m>,
      elliptic curves defined over <m>K</m> which are <m>L</m>-isomorphic to <m>E</m>. (E.g.,
      <m>y^2 = x^3+x+1</m> versus <m>2y^2 = x^3 + x +1</m>,
      with <m>L = \QQ(\sqrt{2})</m>.) See Silverman,
      <em>The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves</em>,
      especially Chapter X, for all this and more fun with <m>H^1</m>,
      including the infamous <em>Selmer group</em>
      and <em>Tate-Shafarevich group</em>.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Fun with <m>H^2</m></title>
    <p>
      We can also give an explicit interpretation of
      <m>H^2(G,M)</m> (see Milne, example II.1.18(b)).
      It classifies short exact sequences
      <me>
        1 \to M \to E \to G \to 1
      </me>
      of (not necessarily abelian) groups on which <m>G</m> has a fixed action on <m>M</m>.
      (The action is given as follows:
      given <m>g \in G</m> and <m>m \in M</m>,
      choose <m>h \in E</m> lifting <m>G</m>;
      then <m>h^{-1}mh</m> maps to the identity in <m>G</m>,
      so comes from <m>M</m>,
      and we call it <m>m^g</m> since it depends only on <m>g</m>.)
      Namely, given the sequence, choose a map <m>s: G \to E</m>
      (not a homomorphism)
      such that <m>s(g)</m> maps to <m>g</m> under the map <m>E \to G</m>.
      Then the map <m>\phi: G^3 \to M</m> given by
      <me>
        \phi(a,b,c) = s(a)^{-1} s(ba^{-1})^{-1} s(cb^{-1})^{-1} s(ca^{-1}) s(a)
      </me>
      is a homogeneous 2-cocycle,
      and any two choices of <m>s</m> give maps that differ by a 2-coboundary.

      What
      <q>classifies</q>
      means here is that two sequences give the same element of
      <m>H^2(G,M)</m> if and only if one can find an arrow
      <m>E \to E'</m> making the following diagram commute:
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-cohom2-1">
    <image>
    <latex-image>
    \xymatrix{
    1 \ar[r] &amp; M \ar^{\id}[d] \ar[r] &amp; E \ar[d] \ar[r] &amp; G \ar^{\id}[d] \ar[r] &amp; 1 \\
    1 \ar[r] &amp; M \ar[r] &amp; E' \ar[r] &amp; G \ar[r] &amp; 1
    }
    </latex-image>
    </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Note that two sequences may not be isomorphic under this definition even if <m>E</m> and <m>E'</m> are abstractly isomorphic as groups.
      For example,
      if <m>G = M = \ZZ/p\ZZ</m> and the action is trivial,
      then <m>H^2(G, M) = \ZZ/p\ZZ</m> even though there are only two possible groups <m>E</m>,
      namely <m>\ZZ/p^2\ZZ</m> and <m>\ZZ/p\ZZ \times \ZZ/p\ZZ</m>.

    <title>Extended functoriality</title>
    <p>
      We already saw that if we have a homomorphism of <m>G</m>-modules,
      we get induced homomorphisms on cohomology groups.
      But what if we want to relate <m>G</m>-modules for different groups <m>G</m>,
      as will happen in our study of class field theory?
      It turns out that in a suitable sense,
      the cohomology groups are also functorial with respect to changing <m>G</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>M</m> be a <m>G</m>-module and <m>M'</m> a <m>G'</m>-module.
      Suppose we are given a homomorphism
      <m>\alpha: G' \to G</m> of groups and a homomorphism <m>\beta: M \to M'</m> of abelian groups
      (note that they go in opposite directions!).
      We say these are <em>compatible</em>
      if <m>\beta(m^{\alpha(g)}) = \beta(m)^g</m> for all <m>g \in G</m> and <m>m \in M</m>.
      In this case,
      one gets canonical homomorphisms <m>H^i(G, M) \to H^i(G', M')</m>
      (construct them on pairs of injective resolutions,
      then show that any two choices are homotopic).
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal examples are as follows.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Note that cohomology groups don't seem to carry a nontrivial <m>G</m>-action,
            because you compute them by taking invariants.
            This can be reinterpreted in terms of extended functoriality:
            let <m>\alpha: G \to G</m> be the conjugation by some fixed <m>h</m>:
            <m>g \mapsto h^{-1}gh</m>,
            and let <m>\beta: M \to M</m> be the map <m>m \mapsto m^h</m>.
            Then the induced homomorphisms
            <m>H^i(G,M) \to H^i(G,M)</m> are all the identity map.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>,
            <m>M</m> is a <m>G</m>-module,
            and <m>M'</m> is just <m>M</m> with all but the <m>H</m>-action forgotten,
            we get the <em>restriction homomorphisms</em>
            <me>
              \Res: H^i(G, M) \to H^i(H, M)
            </me>.
            Another way to get the same map:
            use the adjunction homomorphism
            <m>M \to \Ind^G_H M</m> from <xref ref="P_adjoint_property">Proposition</xref>
            sending <m>m</m> to <m>\sum_i m^{g_i} \otimes [g_i^{-1}]</m>,
            where <m>g_i</m> runs over a set of right coset representatives of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m>,
            then apply Shapiro's Lemma to get
            <me>
              H^i(G, M) \to H^i(G, \Ind^G_H M) \stackrel{\sim}{\to} H^i(H, M)
            </me>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Take notation as in (a),
            but this time consider the map
            <m>\Ind^G_H M \to M</m> taking <m>m \otimes [g]</m> to <m>m^g</m>.
            We then get maps <m>H^i(G, \Ind^G_H M) \to H^i(G,M)</m> which,
            together with the isomorphisms of Shapiro's lemma,
            give what are called the <em>corestriction homomorphisms</em>:
            <me>
              \Cor: H^i(H, M) \stackrel{\sim}{\to} H^i(G, \Ind^G_H M) \to H^i(G, M)
            </me>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The composition <m>\Cor \circ \Res</m> is induced by the homomorphism of <m>G</m>-modules <m>M \to \Ind^G_H M \to M</m> given by
            <me>
              m \mapsto \sum_i m^{g_i} \otimes [g_i^{-1}] \to \sum_i m = [G:H]m
            </me>.
            Thus <m>\Cor \circ \Res</m> acts as multiplication by <m>[G:H]</m> on each (co)homology group.
            Bonus consequence (hereafter excluding the case of <m>H^0</m>):
            if we take <m>H</m> to be the trivial group,
            then the group in the middle is isomorphic to <m>H^i(H, M) = 0</m>.
            So every cohomology group for <m>G</m> is killed by <m>\#G</m>,
            and in particular is a torsion group.
            In fact, if <m>M</m> is finitely generated as an abelian group,
            this means <m>H^i(G, M)</m> is always finite,
            because each of these will be finitely generated and torsion. (Of course,
            this won't happen in many of our favorite examples,
            e.g., <m>H^i(\Gal(L/K), L^*)</m> for <m>L</m> and <m>K</m> fields.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>H</m> is a <em>normal</em> subgroup of <m>G</m>,
            let <m>\alpha</m> be the surjection <m>G \to G/H</m>,
            and let <m>\beta</m> be the injection <m>M^H \hookrightarrow M</m>.
            Note that <m>G/H</m> acts on <m>M^H</m>;
            in this case, we get the <em>inflation homomorphisms</em>
            <me>
              \Inf: H^i(G/H, M^H) \to H^i(G, M)
            </me>.
            The inflation and restriction maps will interact in an interesting way;
            see <xref ref="P_inflation_restriction">Proposition</xref>.
