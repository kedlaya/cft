    This text is a lightly edited version of the lecture notes of a course on class field theory (Math 254B) that I gave at
    UC Berkeley in the spring of 2002. To describe the scope of the course, I can do no better than to quote from the original syllabus:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Class field theory, the study of abelian extensions of number fields, was a crowning achievement of number theory in the first half of the 20th century. 
      It brings together, in a unified fashion, the quadratic and higher reciprocity laws of Gauss, Legendre et al, and vastly generalizes them. 
      Some of its consequences (e.g., the Chebotarev density theorem) apply even to nonabelian extensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our approach in this course will be to begin with the formulations of the statements of class field theory, omitting the proofs (except for the Kronecker-Weber theorem, which we prove first). 
      We then proceed to study the cohomology of groups, an important technical tool both for class field theory and for many other applications in number theory. 
      From there, we set up a local form of class field theory, then proceed to the main results. 
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  The assumed background for the course was a one-semester graduate course in algebraic number theory, including the following topics: 
  number fields and rings of integers; structure of the class and unit groups; splitting, ramification,
  and inertia of prime ideals under finite extensions; different and discriminant; basic properties of local fields.
  In fact, most of the students in Math 254B had attended such a course that I gave the previous
  semester (Math 254A) based on chapters I, II, and III of Neukirch's book <xref ref="bib-Neukirch"/>; 
  for that reason, it was natural to use that book as a primary reference. 
  However, no special features of that presentation are assumed, so just about any graduate-level text on algebraic
  number theory (e.g., Fr\"ohlich-Taylor <xref ref="bib-Frohlich-Taylor"/>, Janusz <xref ref="bib-Janusz"/>, Jarvis, Lang <xref ref="bib-Lang"/>) should provide suitable background.
</p>
<p>
  After the course ended, I kept the lecture notes posted on my web site in their originally written, totally uncorrected state.
  Despite their roughness, I heard back from many people over the years who had found them useful;
  as a result, I decided to prepare a corrected version of the notes. In so doing, I made a conscious decision
  to suppress any temptation to modify 
  the presentation with the benefit of hindsight, or to fill in additional material to make the text more self-contained.
  This decision, while largely dictated by lack of time and energy, was justified by the belief that the
  informality of the original notes contributed to their readibility. In other words, this is not intended as a standalone
  replacement for a good book on class field theory!
</p>
<p>
  I maintain very few claims of originality concerning the presentation of the material. 
  Besides <xref ref="bib-Neukirch"/>, the main source of inspiration was Milne's lecture notes on class field theory <xref ref="bib-Milne-CFT"/>.
  The basic approach may be summarized as follows: I follow Milne's treatment of local class field theory using group cohomology, then follow Neukirch to  recast local class field theory in the style of Artin-Tate's class formations, then reuse the same framework to obtain global class field theory.

As of winter 2021, I am using these notes for <url href="https://math.ucsd.edu/~kkedlaya/math204b/">a class </url> and so am starting to make somewhat more serious revisions.
Corrections and comments are welcome.
