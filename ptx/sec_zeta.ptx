    <title>The Dedekind zeta function of a number field</title>
    <p>
      Although this is supposed to be a course on algebraic number theory,
      the following analytic discussion is so fundamental that we must at least allude to it here.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Let <m>K</m> be a number field.
        The <term>Dedekind zeta function</term> <m>\zeta_K(s)</m> is a function on the complex plane given,
        for <m>\Real(s) > 1</m>, by the absolutely convergent product and sum
        <me>
          \zeta_K(s) = \prod_\gothp (1 - \Norm(\gothp)^{-s})^{-1} = \zeta_K(s) = \sum_{\gotha} \Norm(\gotha)^{-s}
        </me>
        where <m>\gothp</m> runs over the nonzero prime ideals of <m>\gotho_K</m> 
        and <m>\gotha</m> runs over the nonzero ideals of <m>\gotho_K</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For exmaple, if <m>K = \QQ</m>, then <m>\zeta_K</m> equals the Riemann zeta function.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <p>
      A fundamental fact about the zeta function is the following.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_meromorphic_continuation">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The function <m>\zeta_K(s)</m> extends to a meromorphic function on <m>\CC</m> whose only pole is a simple pole at <m>s=1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          See <xref ref="bib-Neukirch"/>, Corollary VII.5.11.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <remark>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="T_meromorphic_continuation"/>, the residue of the pole at <m>s=1</m> is computed by the <term>analytic class number formula</term>;
        it is the product of the class number, the unit regulator, and another quantity that depends on the discriminant and signature of <m>K</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also a functional equation relating the values of <m>\zeta_K</m> at <m>s</m> and <m>1-s</m>,
        and an extended Riemann hypothesis: aside from <q>trivial</q> zeros along the negative real axis,
        the zeroes of <m>\zeta_K</m> all have real part <m>1/2</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title><m>L</m>-functions of abelian characters</title>
    <definition xml:id="def-L-function">
      <p>
      More generally,
      let <m>\gothm</m> be a formal product of places of <m>K</m>,
      and let <m>\chi_\gothm: \Cl^\gothm(K) \to \CC^*</m> be a character of the ray class group of conductor <m>\gothm</m>.
      Extend <m>\chi_\gothm</m> to a function on all ideals of <m>K</m> by declaring its value to be 0 on ideals not coprime to <m>\gothm</m>.
      Then we define the <term><m>L</m>-function</term>
      <me>
        L(s, \chi_\gothm) = \prod_{\gothp \not| \gothm} (1 - \chi(\gothp) \Norm(\gothp)^{-s})^{-1} = \sum_{(\gotha, \gothm) = 1} \chi(\gotha) \Norm(\gotha)^{-s};
      </me>
      again the product converges absolutely for <m>\Real(s) > 1</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <theorem xml:id="T_analytic_continuation">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>\chi_\gothm</m> is not trivial,
          then <m>L(s, \chi_\gothm)</m> extends to an analytic function on <m>\CC</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          See <xref ref="bib-Neukirch"/>, Theorem VII.2.8 (or Theorem VII.8.5).
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <remark>
      <p>
        By contrast with <xref ref="T_analytic_continuation"/>, if <m>\chi_\gothm</m> is trivial,
        then <m>L(s, \chi_\gothm)</m> is just the Dedekind zeta function with the Euler factors for primes dividing <m>\gothm</m> removed,
        so it still has a pole at <m>s=1</m> by <xref ref="T_meromorphic_continuation"/>.
      </p>
    </remark>

  <subsection>
    <title>Nonvanishing of <m>L</m>-functions and consequences</title>
    <p>
      One more basic fact is the following.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_nonvanishing_of_L">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>\chi_\gothm</m> is not the trivial character, then <m>L(1, \chi_\gothm) \neq 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          See <xref ref="bib-Neukirch"/>, Theorem VII.2.9.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      For <m>K = \QQ</m>, <xref ref="T_nonvanishing_of_L"/> is already a nontrivial but important result:
      it implies Dirichlet's famous theorem that there are infinitely many primes in arithmetic progression, as follows.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-dirichlet-density">
      <p>
        A set of primes <m>S</m> in a number field <m>K</m> has <term>Dirichlet density</term> <m>d</m> if
        <me>
          \lim_{s \to 1^+} \frac{\sum_{\gothp \in S} \Norm(\gothp)^{-s}}{\log \frac{1}{s-1}} = d.
        </me>
        This in particular presumes the existence of the limit; otherwise, we may still define the <term>lower Dirichlet density</term>
        and <term>upper Dirichlet density</term> using the limits inferior and superior.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark>
      <p>
        <xref ref="T_nonvanishing_of_L"/> implies that the Dirichlet density of the set of primes congruent to <m>a</m> modulo <m>m</m>
        is <m>1/\phi(m)</m> if <m>a</m> is coprime to <m>m</m> (and <m>0</m> otherwise).
        The key point is that for any nontrivial <m>\chi_\gothm</m>,
        <m>\sum_{\gothp} \chi(\gothp) \Norm(\gothp)^{-s}</m> remains bounded as <m>s \to \infty</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fact also implies that for any number field <m>K</m> and any formal product of places <m>\gothm</m>,
        there are infinitely many primes in each class of the ray class group of conductor <m>\gothm</m>,
        the set of such primes having Dirichlet density <m>1/\#\Cl^\gothm(K)</m>.
        (See <xref ref="exc-density-of-ray-classes"/>.)

    </remark>

  <subsection>
    <title>The Chebotar&#xeb;v density theorem</title>
    <p>
      Finally, we point out a result of class field theory that also applies to nonabelian extensions.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Recall that if <m>L/K</m> is any Galois extension of number fields with Galois group <m>G</m>,
        <m>\gothp</m> is a prime of <m>K</m> which does not ramify in <m>L</m>,
        and <m>\gothq</m> is a prime above <m>\gothp</m>,
        then there is a well-defined <term>Frobenius element</term> to <m>\gothq</m>: it's the element <m>g</m> of the decomposition group
        <m>G_{\gothq}</m> such that <m>x^g \equiv x^{\#(\gotho_K/\gothp)} \pmod{\gothq}</m>.
        Keep in mind that as a function of <m>\gothp</m>, this Frobenius is only well-defined up to conjugation in <m>G</m>.
        (If <m>\gothp</m> ramifies in <m>L</m>, then a further ambiguity occurs: the Frobenius element associated to <m>\gothq</m> is only well-defined
        in the quotient of <m>G_{\gothq}</m> by the inertia group <m>I_{\gothq}</m>.)
      </p>
    </definition>
    <theorem xml:id="T_Chebotarev">
      <title>Chebotar&#xeb;v density theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L/K</m> be a Galois extension of number fields with Galois group <m>G</m>.
          Then for any <m>g \in G</m>,
          there exist infinitely many primes <m>\gothp</m> of <m>K</m> such that there is a prime <m>\gothq</m> of <m>L</m> above <m>\gothp</m> with Frobenius <m>g</m>.
          In fact, the Dirichlet density of such primes <m>\gothp</m> is the order of the conjugacy class of <m>G</m> divided by <m>\#G</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          This follows from everything we have said so far,
          plus Artin reciprocity, in case <m>L/K</m> is abelian.
          In the general case, let <m>f</m> be the order of <m>g</m>,
          and let <m>K'</m> be the fixed field of <m>g</m>;
          then we know that the set of primes of <m>K'</m> with Frobenius
          <m>g \in \Gal(L/K') \subset G</m> has Dirichlet density <m>1/f</m>.
          The same is true if we restrict to primes of absolute degree 1
          (see <xref ref="exc-density-split-1"/>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>Z</m> be the centralizer of <m>g</m> in <m>G</m>;
          that is, <m>Z = \{z \in G: zg = gz\}</m>.
          Then for each prime of <m>K</m> of absolute degree 1)
          with Frobenius in the conjugacy class of <m>g</m>,
          there are <m>\#Z/f</m> primes of <m>K'</m> above it
          (also of absolute degree 1)
          with Frobenius <m>g</m>.
          (Say <m>\gothp</m> is such a prime and <m>\gothq</m> is a prime of <m>L</m> above <m>\gothp</m> with Frobenius <m>g</m>.
          Then for <m>h \in G</m>,
          the Frobenius of <m>\gothq^h</m> is <m>hgh^{-1}</m>,
          so the number of primes <m>\gothq</m> with Frobenius <m>g</m> is <m>\#Z</m>.
          But each prime of <m>L'</m> below one of these is actually below <m>f</m> of them.)
          Thus the density of primes of <m>K</m> with Frobenius in the conjugacy class of <m>g</m> is <m>(1/f)(1/(\#Z/f)) = 1/\#Z</m>.
          To conclude,
          note that the order of the conjugacy class of <m>G</m> is <m>\#G/\#Z</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      We state the following here as a corollary of <xref ref="T_Chebotarev"/>; however, we will eventually prove it <em>before</em>
      proving Artin reciprocity (see <xref ref="C_split_completely"/>).
    </p>
    <corollary xml:id="cor-some-primes-split">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L/K</m> be a nontrivial extension of number fields. Then there exist infinitely many primes of <m>K</m> which do not split completely in <m>L</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>M/K</m> be the Galois closure of <m>L/K</m>, and set <m>G = \Gal(M/K), H = \Gal(M/L)</m>.
          By hypothesis, <m>G</m> is not the trivial group and the conjugates of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m> have trivial intersection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>\gothp</m> be any prime of <m>K</m> which does not ramify in <m>M</m> and let <m>\gothq</m> be a prime of <m>M</m> above <m>K</m>.
          Then <m>\gothp</m> splits completely in <m>M</m> if and only if the Frobenius element of <m>\gothq</m> is trivial.
          Moreover, if <m>\gothp</m> splits completely in <m>L</m>, then <m>g</m> lies in every conjugate of <m>H</m> and hence must be trivial,
          so <m>\gothp</m> also splits completely in <m>M</m>. (The converse is also true.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>G \neq H</m>, we can choose an element <m>g \in G \setminus H</m>. 
          By <xref ref="T_Chebotarev"/>, there exist infinitely many primes <m>\gothp</m>
          of <m>K</m> for which there is a prime <m>\gothq</m> of <m>L</m> above <m>\gothp</m> with Frobenius <m>g</m>.
          By the previous discussion, any such <m>\gothp</m> does not split completely in <m>K</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </corollary>
    <remark>
      <p>
        <xref ref="T_Chebotarev"/> is a special case of a much more general equidistribution conjecture including, among other things,
        the <term>Sato-Tate conjecture</term> on the distribution of Frobenius traces of elliptic curves. See 
        <xref ref="bib-Serre-NXp"/> for an introduction to this circle of ideas.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
        With somewhat more work, all of the previous density assertions remain true (and are indeed strictly stronger than before)
        if Dirichlet density is replaced by natural density. The <term>natural density</term> of a set <m>S</m> of prime ideals of a number field <m>K</m>
        is the limit (if it exists)
        <me>
           \lim_{X \to \infty} \frac{\#\{\gothp: \gothp \in S, \Norm(\gothp) \leq X\}}{\#\{\gothp: \Norm(\gothp) \leq X\}}
        </me>
        where in both sets <m>\gothp</m> runs over all prime ideals of <m>K</m>. (Again, if the limit does not exist, we may still define the <term>lower natural density</term>
        and <term>upper natural density</term> using the limits inferior and superior.)
      </p>
      <p>
        As with the prime number theorem, one can obtain effective power-saving error estimates conditional on the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for 
        appropriate Artin <m>L</m>-functions. See <xref ref="bib-Lagarias-Odlyzko"/>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
        For fun, we mention a lesser-known result of Chebotar&#xeb;v here: the character table of a finite cyclic group, viewed as a square matrix, has the property that every minor is nonzero.        
      </p>
      <p>
        By contrast, for a group which is abelian but not cyclic there exists a <m>2 \times 2</m> submatrix with all entries equal to 1,
        whereas for a nonabelian group any nonabelian character takes the value 0 somewhere (a result of Burnside; see <xref ref="bib-Isaacs"/>, Theorem 3.15).
