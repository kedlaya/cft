    <title>Statement of the theorem</title>
    <p>
      For a change, we're going to prove something, although the proof will depend on the Artin reciprocity law which we haven't proved.
      Or rather, we're going to sketch a proof that you will get to fill in by doing the exercises. (Why should I have all the fun?)
    </p>
    <p>
      The following theorem is due to Furtw&#xe4;ngler, a student of Hilbert.
      (It's also called the <q>capitulation</q> theorem, because the word <q>capitulate</q> was formerly used to mean <q>to become principal</q>. 
      Etymology left to the reader.)
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_principal_ideal_theorem">
      <title>Principal ideal theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L</m> be the Hilbert class field of the number field <m>K</m>.
          Then every ideal of <m>K</m> becomes principal in <m>L</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <example>
      if <m>K = \QQ(\sqrt{-5})</m>,
      then <m>L = \QQ(\sqrt{-5}, \sqrt{-1})</m>,
      and the nonprincipal ideal class of <m>K</m> is represented by <m>(2, 1+\sqrt{-5})</m>,
      which is generated by <m>1+\sqrt{-1}</m> in <m>L</m>.
    </example>

    <title>First steps of the proof</title>
    <p>
      The idea of the proof is to apply Artin reciprocity to reduce to a problem purely in finite group theory, which we then solve.
      To this end, let <m>M</m> be the Hilbert class field of <m>L</m>;
      then an ideal of <m>L</m> is principal if and only if its image under the Artin map <m>I_L \to \Gal(M/L)</m> is trivial.
      So our first step will be to give a purely group-theoretic description of the map <m>V: \Gal(L/K) \to \Gal(M/L)</m>
      corresponding to the extension homomorphism <m>\Cl(K) \to \Cl(L)</m> (i.e., making the diagram in <xref ref="fig-principal-1"/> commute,
      in which the horizontal arrows are Artin maps).
    </p>

      In order to proceed further, we must extract more information about the Galois groups in question.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            The extension <m>M/K</m> is unramified because <m>M/L</m> and <m>L/K</m> are.
            It is also Galois: its image under any element of <m>\Gal(\overline{K}/K)</m> is still an unramified abelian extension of <m>L</m>
            and so is contained in <m>M</m>. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The maximal subextension of <m>M/K</m> which is abelian over <m>K</m> is equal to <m>L</m>.

    <title>Translation into group theory</title>
    <definition>
      Given a finite group <m>G</m>,
      let <m>G^{\ab}</m> denote the maximal abelian quotient of <m>G</m>;
      that is, <m>G^{\ab}</m> is the quotient of <m>G</m> by its commutator subgroup <m>G'</m>.
      Then the previous discussion implies that <m>\Gal(M/L)</m> is the commutator subgroup of
      <m>\Gal(M/K)</m> and <m>\Gal(M/K)^{\ab} = \Gal(L/K)</m>.
      We may thus relabel <xref ref="fig-principal-1"/> as in <xref ref="fig-principal-2"/>.

    We now give the purely group-theoretic interpretation of the map <m>V</m> in <xref ref="fig-principal-2"/>.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-transfer-homomorphism">
      <p>
      Let <m>G</m> be a finite group and <m>H</m> a (not necessarily normal) subgroup.
      Let <m>g_1, \dots, g_n</m> be left coset representatives of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m>:
      that is, <m>G = g_1H \cup \cdots \cup g_nH</m>.
      For <m>g \in G</m>, put <m>\phi(g) = g_i</m> if
      <m>g \in g_iH</m> (i.e., <m>g_i^{-1}g \in H</m>).
      Put
      <me>
        V(g) = \prod_{i=1}^n \phi(gg_i)^{-1}(gg_i);
      </me>
      then <m>V(g)</m> always lands in <m>H</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Now consider what happens when we compose the map <m>g \mapsto V(g): G \to H</m>
      (which is not necessarily a homomorphism) with the projection <m>H \to H^{\ab}</m>.
      It will follow from <xref ref="T_transfer_homomorphism"/> that the resulting map 
      <m>G \to H^{\ab}</m> is a homomorphism which factors through <m>G^{\ab}</m>.
      The induced map <m>V: G^{\ab} \to H^{\ab}</m> is called the <term>transfer map</term>
      (in German <q>Verlagerung</q>, hence the use of the letter <m>V</m> in the notation).

      <statement>
        <p>
          With notation as in <xref ref="def-transfer-homomorphism"/>,
          the map <m>V: G \to H^{\ab}</m> is a homomorphism;
          it does not depend on the choice of the <m>g_i</m>;
          and induces a homomorphism <m>G^{\ab} \to H^{\ab}</m> (i.e., kills commutators in <m>G</m>).

      </statement>
      <proof>
        See <xref ref="exc-transfer-homomorphism"/>.
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      Setting aside the proof of <xref ref="T_transfer_homomorphism"/> for the moment, let's see that this does indeed give the
      correct map in <xref ref="fig-principal-2"/> when we take <m>G = \Gal(M/K)</m> and <m>H = \Gal(M/L)</m>,
      so that <m>G/H = \Gal(L/K)</m>. This amounts to computing what happens when we apply all of the maps starting with a prime
      <m>\gothp</m> of <m>K</m> at the top left of the diagram.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose a prime <m>\gothq</m> of <m>L</m> over <m>\gothp</m> and a prime <m>\gothr</m> of <m>M</m> over <m>\gothq</m>,
      let <m>G_{\gothr} \subseteq G</m> be the decomposition group of <m>\gothr</m> over <m>K</m> (i.e., the stabilizer of <m>\gothr</m> under the action
      of <m>G</m> on the primes above <m>\gothp</m>), and let <m>g \in G_{\gothr}</m> be the Frobenius of <m>\gothr</m>.
      Keep in mind that since <m>G</m> is not abelian, <m>g</m> depends on the choice of <m>\gothr</m>,
      not just on <m>\gothq</m>; that is, there's no Artin map into <m>G</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>\gothq_1, \dots, \gothq_r</m> be the primes of <m>L</m> above <m>\gothp</m>;
      then the image of <m>\gothp</m> in <m>L</m> is <m>\prod_i \gothq_i</m>,
      and the image of that product under the Artin map is <m>\prod_i \Frob_{M/L}(\gothq_i)</m>.
      To show that this equals <m>V(g)</m>,
      we make a careful choice of the coset representatives <m>g_i</m> in the definition of <m>V</m>.
      Namely, decompose <m>G</m> as a union of double cosets <m>G_{\gothr} \tau_i H</m>.
      Then the primes of <m>L</m> above <m>\gothp</m> correspond to these double cosets,
      where the double coset <m>G_{\gothr} \tau_i H</m> corresponds to <m>L \cap \gothr^{\tau_i}</m>.
      Let <m>m</m> be the order of
      <m>\Frob_{L/K}(\gothp)</m> and write <m>G_{\gothr} \tau_i H = \tau_iH \cup g\tau_i H \cup \cdots \cup g^{m-1}\tau_i H</m> for each <m>i</m>;
      we then use the elements <m>g_{ij} = g^j \tau_i</m> as the left coset representatives to define <m>\phi</m> and <m>V</m>.
      Thus the equality <m>V(g) = \prod_i \Frob_{M/L}(\gothq_i)</m> follows from the following lemma.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="L_transfer_Frobenius">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>L \cap \gothr^{\tau_i} = \gothq_i</m>,
          then <m>\Frob_{M/L}(\gothq_i) = \prod_{j=0}^{m-1} \phi(g g_{ij})^{-1} g g_{ij}</m>.

    <title>The final group-theoretic ingredient</title>
    <p>
      With this, <xref ref="T_principal_ideal_theorem"/> follows from the following fact.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_transfer_vanishes">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> be a finite group and <m>H</m> its commutator subgroup.
          Then the transfer map <m>V: G^{\ab} \to H^{\ab}</m> is zero.

    <title>One more remark</title>
    <remark xml:id="R-class-field-towers">
      <p>
        One important qualification of <xref ref="T_principal_ideal_theorem"/> is that <m>L</m> need not itself have class number 1.
        In fact, it is an open problem to show that every number field <m>K</m> admits an extension which has class number 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        One approach to constructing such an extension would be to consider the <term>class field tower</term> over <m>K</m>,
        in which <m>K_0 = K</m> and for each positive integer <m>i</m>, <m>K_i</m> is the Hilbert class field of <m>K_{i-1}</m>.
        However, Golod and Shafarevich showed that in certain cases this sequence grows without bound; for example,
        this holds if <m>K</m> is an imaginary quadratic field in which at least six distinct primes of <m>\QQ</m> ramify.
        In particular, in such cases <m>K</m> admits an <em>infinite</em> unramified extension.
      (See <xref ref="bib-Cassels-Frohlich"/> for more discussion.)
