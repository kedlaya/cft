    <title>An example of an unramified extension</title>
    <p>
      Recall that the field <m>\QQ</m> has no extensions which are everywhere unramified (<xref ref="T_Minkowski"/>).
      This is quite definitely not true of other number fields; we begin with an example illustrating this.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex-unramified">
      <title>An unramified extension of a number field</title>
      <p>
        In the number field <m>K = \QQ(\sqrt{-5})</m>,
        the ring of integers is <m>\ZZ[\sqrt{-5}]</m> and the ideal <m>(2)</m> factors as <m>\gothp^2</m>,
        where the ideal <m>\gothp = (2, 1 + \sqrt{-5})</m> is not principal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let's see what happens when we adjoin a square root of <m>-1</m>,
        obtaining <m>L = \QQ(\sqrt{-5}, \sqrt{-1})</m>.
        The extension <m>\QQ(\sqrt{-1})/\QQ</m> only ramifies over 2, so <m>L/K</m> can only be ramified over <m>\gothp</m>.
        On the other hand, if we write
        <m>L = K(\alpha)</m> where <m>\alpha = (1 + \sqrt{5})/2</m>,
        then modulo <m>\gothp</m> the minimal polynomial <m>x^2-x-1</m> of <m>\alpha</m> remains irreducible,
        so <m>\gothp</m> is unramified
        (and not split)
        in <m>L</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <title>Hilbert class fields</title>
    <p>
      We've now seen that <m>\QQ(\sqrt{-5})</m> admits both a nonprincipal ideal and an unramified abelian extension.
      It turns out these are not unrelated events.

      <title>Jargon watch</title>
      <p>
        In class field theory, the phrase <q><m>L/K</m> is unramified</q> is conventionally interpreted to mean that
        <m>L/K</m> is unramified over all finite places in the usual sense,
        <em>and</em> that every real embedding of <m>K</m> extends to a real embedding of <m>L</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <theorem xml:id="T_Hilbert_class_field">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>L</m> be the maximal unramified abelian extension of a number field <m>K</m>.
          Then <m>L/K</m> is finite,
          and its Galois group is isomorphic to the ideal class group <m>\Cl(K)</m> of <m>K</m>.
          The field <m>L</m> is called the <term>Hilbert class field</term> of <m>K</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          A canonical isomorphism will be given by the Artin reciprocity law (<xref ref="T-Artin-reciprocity"/>).
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <remark>
      <p>
        While <xref ref="T_Hilbert_class_field"/> implies that an abelian unramified extension must be finite,
        there can be infinite unramified <em>nonabelian</em> extensions.
        See <xref ref="R-class-field-towers"/>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
      <p>
        At this point, it should now be apparent that <term>class field theory</term> is <q>class field</q> theory, i.e., the theory of <term>class fields</term> such 
        as the Hilbert class fields (and other examples described in <xref ref="def-ray-class-field"/>) rather than a special type of <q>field theory</q>. Whether this
        affects your pronunciation of the entire phrase is up to you!

        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>K</m> be an imaginary quadratic extension of <m>\QQ</m> in which <m>t</m> finite primes ramify.
            Assuming <xref ref="T_Hilbert_class_field"/>,
            prove that <m>\#(\Cl(K)/2\Cl(K)) = 2^{t-1}</m>;
            this recovers a theorem of Gauss originally proved using binary quadratic forms.

            Give an example, using a real quadratic field, to illustrate that:

                <p>
                  <xref ref="T_Hilbert_class_field"/> fails if we don't require the extensions to be unramified above the real place;

            Prove that <xref ref="exer-genus-theory"/> extends to real quadratic fields if one replaces the class group by the
            <term>narrow class group</term>,
            in which you only mod out by principal ideals having a totally positive generator.
            This gives an example of a <term>ray class group</term>;

            The field <m>\QQ(\sqrt{-23})</m> admits an ideal of order 3 in the class group and an unramified abelian extension of degree 3.

            Prove that the Galois closure of <m>K</m> is unramified over all finite places of <m>\QQ(\sqrt{D})</m>. This gives an ample supply

            Let <m>M</m> be the Galois closure of <m>K</m>.
            For any odd prime <m>p</m> dividing the discriminant, use the restriction on <m>D</m> to show that 
            there is exactly one prime of <m>K</m> above <m>p</m> which is ramified and that its ramification index is 2.
            Then deduce that the inertia group of a prime of <m>M</m> above <m>p</m> has order 2, and finally argue that said prime is unramified over
            its restriction to <m>\QQ(\sqrt{D})</m>.
