      We next manufacture a canonical isomorphism
      <m>\Gal(L/K)^{\ab} \to C_K/\Norm_{L/K} C_L</m> for any finite extension <m>L/K</m> of number fields,
      where <m>C_K</m> and <m>C_L</m> are the corresponding id&#xe8;le class groups (<xref ref="T_abstract_adelic_reciprocity"/>).
      However, we won't yet know it agrees with our proposed reciprocity map,
      which is the product of the local reciprocity maps.
      We'll come back to this point after we establish the existence theorem (see <xref ref="sec_connection"/>).

    <title>Abstract unit groups and the class field axiom</title>
    <p>
      We will be applying abstract class field theory with <m>k = \QQ</m> and <m>\kbar = \overline{\QQ}</m>, an algebraic closure of <m>\QQ</m>.
      We first specify the <m>\Gal(\overline{\QQ}/\QQ)</m>-module <m>A</m> which will give rise to abstract unit groups.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-global-abstract-units">
      <p>
        Set <m>A = \bigcup_K C_K</m>, so that <m>A_K = C_K</m> for every number field <m>K</m>.
        Our earlier calculations (<xref ref="T_first_inequality"/>,
        <xref ref="T_first_and_second_inequality"/>)
        imply that the class field axiom is satisfied:
        for <m>L/K</m> a cyclic extension of number fields,
        <me>
          \#H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), C_L) = [L:K], \qquad \#H^1_T(\Gal(L/K), C_L) = 1.
        </me>
        Note that at this point we neither know, nor need to know, that <m>H^0_T(\Gal(L/K), C_L)</m> is cyclic.

    <title>Cyclotomic extensions and abstract ramification theory</title>
    <p>
      The cyclotomic extensions of a number field play a role in class field theory analogous to the role played by the unramified extensions in local class field theory.
      This makes it essential to make an explicit study of them for use in proving the main results. However, we will not need the Kronecker-Weber theorem
      (<xref ref="T_Kronecker-Weber"/>); instead, we will recover it as part of the reciprocity law.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all,
      we should further articulate a distinction that has come up already.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <p>
        The extension <m>\bigcup_n \QQ(\zeta_n)</m> of <m>\QQ</m> obtained by adjoining all roots of unity has Galois group <m>\widehat{\ZZ}^* = \prod_p \ZZ_p^*</m>.
        That group has a lot of torsion,
        since each <m>\ZZ_p^*</m> contains a torsion subgroup of order <m>p-1</m>
        (or 2, if <m>p=2</m>).
        If we take the fixed field for the torsion subgroup of <m>\ZZ^*</m>,
        we get a slightly smaller extension,
        which I'll call the <term>small cyclotomic extension</term>
        of <m>\QQ</m> and denote <m>\QQ^{\smcy}</m>.
        Its Galois group is <m>\prod_p \ZZ_p = \widehat{\ZZ}</m>.
        For <m>K</m> a number field, define <m>K^{\smcy} = K \QQ^{\smcy}</m>;
        then <m>\Gal(K^{\smcy}/K) \cong \widehat{\ZZ}</m> as well,
        even if <m>K</m> contains some extra roots of unity.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <p>
      With this definition in hand, we can set up the homomorphism <m>d</m> needed to define abstract ramification theory for the base field <m>k = \QQ</m>.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-global-abstract-ramification">
    <p>
      Choose an isomorphism of
      <m>\Gal(\QQ^{\smcy}/\QQ)</m> with <m>\widehat{\ZZ}</m>;
      our results are not going to depend on the choice (see <xref ref="rmk-remove-identification"/>).
      That gives a continuous surjection
      <me>
        d: \Gal(\overline{\QQ}/\QQ) \to \Gal(\QQ^{\smcy}/\QQ) \cong \widehat{\ZZ};
      </me>
      recall that this means we are going to regard <m>\QQ^{\smcy}/\QQ</m> as the <q>maximal unramified extension</q>
      of <m>\QQ</m>. As in the general setup, for any finite extension <m>L/K</m> of number fields, we define the
      <term>abstract ramification index</term> <m>e_{L/K}</m> and the <term>abstract inertia degree</term> <m>f_{L/K}</m> by setting
      <me>
        f_{L/K} = [L \cap \QQ^{\smcy}:K \cap \QQ^{\smcy}], \qquad e_{L/K} = \frac{[L:K]}{f_{L/K}}.

    <title>An abstract henselian valuation</title>
    <p>
      To complete the setup of abstract class field theory, we need an abstract henselian valuation <m>v: C_{\QQ} \to \widehat{\ZZ}</m>.
      Recall from <xref ref="def-abstract-henselian-valuation"/> that this means:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>v(C_{\QQ})</m> is a subgroup <m>Z</m> of <m>\widehat{\ZZ}</m> containing <m>\ZZ</m> with <m>Z/nZ \cong \ZZ/n\ZZ</m> for all positive integers <m>n</m>;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>v(\Norm_{K/\QQ} C_K) = f_{K/\QQ} Z</m> for all finite extensions <m>K/\QQ</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-global-abstract-valuation">
    <p>
      To define the map <m>v</m>, we write 
      <me>
        I_{\QQ} = \QQ^* \times \RR^* \times \widehat{\ZZ}^*
      </me>
      as in <xref ref="rmk-idele-group-presentation-for-Q"/>. We then define <m>v</m> as the projection onto the third factor
      followed by the projection 
      <me>
        \widehat{\ZZ}^* \cong \Gal(\QQ^{\cyc}/\QQ) \to \Gal(\QQ^{\smcy}/\QQ) \cong \widehat{\ZZ}.
      </me>
      The first condition of <xref ref="def-abstract-henselian-valuation"/> holds by construction.
      We will check the second condition using Artin reciprocity for cyclotomic extensions.
    </p>
    </definition>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-global-abstract-valuation">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The map <m>v</m> defined in <xref ref="def-global-abstract-valuation"/> is a henselian valuation in the sense of <xref ref="def-abstract-henselian-valuation"/>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Since we already know from <xref ref="def-global-abstract-valuation"/> that <m>v</m> factors through <m>C_\QQ</m> and surjects onto <m>\widehat{\ZZ}</m>,
          it suffices to check that for every number field <m>K</m>, <m>v(\Norm_{K/\QQ} I_K) = f_{K/\QQ} \widehat{\ZZ}</m>. We establish this by checking that the map
          <me>
            I_K \stackrel{\Norm_{K/\QQ}}{\to} I_\QQ \to \Gal(\QQ^{\cyc}/\QQ)
          </me>
          has image <m>\Gal(K^{\cyc}/K) \subseteq \Gal(\QQ^{\cyc}/\QQ)</m>, as then we get the desired condition by projecting from <m>\Gal(\QQ^{\cyc}/\QQ)</m> to <m>\Gal(\QQ^{\smcy}/\QQ)</m>.
          Note that for <m>K = \QQ</m>, this follows from Artin reciprocity for cyclotomic extensions (<xref ref="D_cyclotomic_reciprocity"/>).
        </p>
        <p>
          In one direction, the fact that <m>I_K</m> maps into <m>\Gal(K^{\cyc}/K)</m> is a corollary of local reciprocity (<xref ref="T_local_reciprocity"/>)
          plus Artin reciprocity for cyclotomic extensions as used above. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In the other direction, the same logic shows that for each positive integer <m>n</m>, the image of <m>I_K</m> in <m>\Gal(K(\zeta_n)/K)</m> equals the image of the classical Artin map for
          <m>K(\zeta_n)/K</m>; it will thus suffice to check that these maps are surjective. It is convenient to deduce this from the First Inequality; see <xref ref="prop-artin-map-surjects"/> below.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>
    <p>
      Here is the consequence of the First Inequality used in the proof of <xref ref="lem-global-abstract-valuation"/>.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="prop-artin-map-surjects">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For <m>L/K</m> an abelian extension of number fields, the Artin map always surjects onto <m>\Gal(L/K)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>H</m> be the image of the Artin map; the fixed field <m>M</m> of <m>H</m> has the property that all but finitely many primes of <m>K</m> split completely in <m>M</m>.
        We've already seen that this contradicts the First Inequality unless <m>M = K</m> (<xref ref="C_split_completely"/>).

    <title>Consequences of abstract CFT</title>
    <p>
      We now apply abstract class field theory to obtain an <q>abstract adelic reciprocity law</q>.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_abstract_adelic_reciprocity">
      <title>Abstract adelic reciprocity law</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For every Galois extension <m>L/K</m> of number fields, we obtain an isomorphism
          <me>
            r'_{L/K}: C_K/\Norm_{L/K} C_L \stackrel{\sim}{\to} \Gal(L/K)^{\ab}.
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The hypotheses of abstract class field theory are satisfied by taking 
          <m>k = \QQ</m> <m>\kbar = \overline{\QQ}</m>; <m>A = \bigcup_K C_K</m> as in <xref ref="def-global-abstract-units"/> (using <xref ref="T_first_inequality"/> and
          <xref ref="T_first_and_second_inequality"/> to verify the class field axiom);
          <m>d: \Gal(\overline{\QQ}/\QQ) \to \widehat{\ZZ}</m> as in <xref ref="def-global-abstract-ramification"/>;
          and <m>v: C_{\QQ} \to \widehat{\ZZ}</m> as in <xref ref="def-global-abstract-valuation"/> (using <xref ref="lem-global-abstract-valuation"/>).
          We may thus apply <xref ref="T_abstract_reciprocity_law"/> to conclude.

    <definition>
      <p>
        The maps <m>r'_{L/K}</m> from <xref ref="T_abstract_adelic_reciprocity"/> fit together to give a map <m>r'_K: C_K \to \Gal(K^{\ab}/K)</m>;
        but we do not yet know that this coincides with the product of the local reciprocity maps, so we cannot yet recover Artin reciprocity.
        However, we can at least deduce the norm limitation theorem (<xref ref="T_adelic_norm_limitation1"/>). See also <xref ref="rmk-remove-identification"/> below.

    <theorem xml:id="T_adelic_norm_limitation">
      <title>Norm limitation theorem</title>
      <statement>

    <remark xml:id="rmk-remove-identification">
      <p>
        Although we do not have a complete description of the isomorphism <m>r'_{L/K}</m> coming from abstract class field theory,
        we do know one specific fact about this map: for <q>unramified</q> extensions <m>L/K</m> (i.e., <m>L \subseteq K^{\smcy}</m>), the
        <q>Frobenius</q> in <m>\Gal(L/K)</m> maps to a <q>uniformizer</q>
        in <m>C_K</m>.
        That is, the element of <m>\Gal(L/K)</m> coming from the element of
        <m>\Gal(K^{\smcy}/K)</m> which maps to 1 under <m>d_K</m> is the element of <m>C_K</m> which maps to 1 under <m>v_K</m>.
        The point is that the definitions of both <m>d</m> and <m>v</m> involve the <em>same</em> artificial choice of 
        an isomorphism <m>\Gal(\QQ^{\smcy}/\QQ) \cong \widehat{\ZZ}</m>; compare <xref ref="rmk-rescale-reciprocity"/> and <xref ref="exer-rescale-reciprocity2"/>.
