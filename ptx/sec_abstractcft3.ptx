    <p>
      We now establish that the reciprocity map is an isomorphism (<xref ref="T_abstract_reciprocity_law"/>).
      We also obtain an analogue of the norm limitation theorem (<xref ref="C_abstract_norm_limitation"/>)
      and some tools which will help with the existence theorem (<xref ref="rmk_abstract_existence"/>).

  <subsection>
    <title>Proof of the reciprocity law</title>
    <p>
      Our goal is to prove that the homomorphism <m>r_{L/K}</m> from <xref ref="def-abstract-recip-final"/> induces an isomorphism
      <m>\Gal(L/K)^{\ab} \to A_K / \Norm_{L/K} A_L</m>. Any resemblance with the proof of the local reciprocity law
      is not at all coincidental!
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-abstract-recip-case1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Under <xref ref="hypo-abstract-cft"/>, 
          for <m>L/K</m> an unramified extension of finite subextensions of <m>\kbar/k</m>,
          <m>r_{L/K}: \Gal(L/K) \to A_K / \Norm_{L/K} A_L</m> is an isomorphism
          sending the Frobenius of <m>\Gal(L/K)</m> to a uniformizer of <m>K</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>g \in \Gal(L/K)</m> be the Frobenius and choose <m>h \in \Gal(L^{\unr}/K)</m> lifting <m>g</m>.
        Then the fixed field of <m>h</m> is <m>K</m> itself,
        and from the definition of <m>r'</m>, <m>r(g) = r'(h)</m> is a uniformizer of <m>K</m>.
        By <xref ref="P_abstract_H0H1"/>, <m>r(g)</m> generates <m>H^0(\Gal(L/K), A_L)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the class field axiom, <m>r_{L/K}</m> maps between two groups of the same order, and the previous paragraph implies that the map is surjective.
        It is thus an isomorphism.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-abstract-recip-case2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Under <xref ref="hypo-abstract-cft"/>,
          for <m>L/K</m> a cyclic, totally ramified extension of finite subextensions of <m>\kbar/k</m>,
          the map <m>r_{L/K}: \Gal(L/K) \to A_K / \Norm_{L/K} A_L</m> is an isomorphism.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
     <p>
        Put <m>n = [L:K]</m>. The extension <m>L^{\unr}/K</m> is the compositum of two linearly disjoint extensions <m>L/K</m> and <m>K^{\unr}/K</m>,
        so its Galois group is canonically a product <m>\Gal(L/K) \times \Gal(K^{\unr}/K)</m>.
        Let <m>g</m> be a generator of the first factor (which we can also identify with <m>\Gal(L^{\unr}/K^{\unr})</m>)
        and let <m>\phi</m> be a generator of the second factor with <m>d_K(\phi) = 1</m>.
        Put <m>\tau = g\phi</m> and let <m>M</m> be the fixed field of <m>\tau</m>.
        Let <m>N</m> be the compositum of <m>L</m> and <m>M</m> and put <m>N_0 = N \cap K^{\unr}</m>.
        We now have the field diagram <xref ref="fig-abstractcft-6"/> in which each line denotes a <m>\ZZ/n\ZZ</m>-extension,
        the dashed lines represent unramified extensions, and each label indicates one or more generators of the Galois group <m>g</m>.

      <p>
        Pick uniformizers <m>\pi_L</m> and <m>\pi_M</m> of <m>L</m> and <m>M</m>, respectively.
        Since <m>d_K(\tau) = 1</m>, by <xref ref="prop_norm"/>
        we have <m>r_{L/K}(g) = \Norm_{L^{\unr}/K^{\unr}}(\pi_M)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>j</m> be the order of <m>r_{L/K}(g)</m> in <m>A_K/\Norm_{L/K} A_L</m> and put <m>u = \pi_M^j/\pi_L^j \in U_N</m>.
        Since both <m>\Norm_{L^{\unr}/K^{\unr}}(\pi_M^j)</m> and <m>\Norm_{L^{\unr}/K^{\unr}}(\pi_L^j) = \Norm_{L/K}(\pi_L^j)</m>
        belong to <m>\Norm_{L/K} A_L</m>, we can choose <m>v \in A_L</m> such that
        <me>
          \Norm_{L^{\unr}/K^{\unr}}(u) = \Norm_{L/K}(v) = \Norm_{L^{\unr}/K^{\unr}}(v).
        </me>
        Since <m>\Norm_{L/K}(v) \in A_K \cap U_N = U_K</m>, we must have <m>v \in U_L</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Applying the class field axiom to <m>N/N_0</m> yields
        <me>
          0 = H^{-1}_T(\Gal(N/N_0), A_N) = \frac{\ker(\Norm_{N/N_0}: A_N \to A_{N_0})}{ \{ a^{g-1}: a \in A_N \}}.
        </me>
        Since <m>\Norm_{N/N_0}(u/v) = \Norm_{L^{\unr}/K^{\unr}}(u/v) = 1</m>, we can write <m>u/v</m> in the form
        <m>a^{g-1} = a^g/a</m> for some <m>a \in A_N</m>. Then
        <me>
          (\pi_L^j v)^{g-1} = (\pi_L^j v)^{\tau-1} = (\pi_M^j v/u)^{\tau - 1} = (v/u)^{\tau-1} = (a/a^\tau)^{g-1}.
        </me>
        If we put <m>x = (\pi_L^j v)(a^\tau/a)</m>, then <m>x^g = x</m> and so <m>x \in A_{N_0}</m>.
        Hence 
        <me>
          j = v_N(x) = nv_{N_0}(x) \in n \widehat{\ZZ}.
        </me>
        That is, the order of <m>r_{L/K}(g)</m> in <m>A_K/\Norm_{L/K} A_L</m> is divisible by <m>n</m> in <m>\widehat{\ZZ}</m>, and hence also in <m>\ZZ</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the class field axiom, <m>r_{L/K}</m> maps between two groups of the same order <m>n</m>, and the previous paragraph implies that the map has image
        of size at least <m>n</m>. It is thus an isomorphism.
      </p>

      Before continuing, we record a key commutative diagram which will be the scene of a lot of diagram-chasing.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-abstract-recip-case3">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Under <xref ref="hypo-abstract-cft"/>, 
          for <m>L/K</m> an abelian extension of finite subextensions of <m>\kbar/k</m>,
          the map <m>r_{L/K}: \Gal(L/K) \to A_K / \Norm_{L/K} A_L</m> is an isomorphism.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          If <m>L/K</m> is cyclic of prime order,
          We induct on <m>[L:K]</m>.
          then either it is unramified or totally ramified,
          and we already know <m>r_{L/K}</m> is an isomorphism in those cases
          (by <xref ref="lem-abstract-recip-case1"/> or <xref ref="lem-abstract-recip-case2"/>, respectively).
          Otherwise, let <m>M</m> be a subextension of <m>L/K</m>.
          Then diagram chasing through <xref ref="fig-abstractcft-1"/> gives that <m>r_{L/K}</m> is surjective.
          If <m>L/K</m> is cyclic, then the class field axiom implies that <m>r_{L/K}</m> is a map between two groups of the same order,
          and hence must be an isomorphism.
          Otherwise, we see from <xref ref="fig-abstractcft-1"/> again that
          the kernel of <m>r_{L/K}</m> lies in the kernel of <m>\Gal(L/K) \to \Gal(N/K)</m> for <em>every</em>
          cyclic subextension <m>N</m> of <m>L/K</m>.
          Since <m>L/K</m> is abelian and not cyclic, the intersection of these kernels is trivial.
          Thus <m>r_{L/K}</m> is also injective, so is an isomorphism.

          Under <xref ref="hypo-abstract-cft"/>, 
          for <m>L/K</m> a Galois extension of finite subextensions of <m>\kbar/k</m>,
          the homomorphism <m>r_{L/K}</m> from <xref ref="def-abstract-recip-final"/> induces an injection
          <m>\Gal(L/K)^{\ab} \to A_K / \Norm_{L/K} A_L</m>.

        <p>
          Let <m>M</m> be the maximal abelian subextension of <m>L/K</m>. We have the following commutative diagram:
          <figure xml:id="fig-abstractcft-2">
          <image>
          <latex-image>
          \xymatrix{

          \Gal(M/K) \ar^{r_{M/K}}[r] &amp; A_K / \Norm_{M/K} A_M

          in which the left vertical arrow and bottom horizontal arrows are isomorphisms
          (the latter by <xref ref="lem-abstract-recip-case3"/>).
          Thus the composite <m>\Gal(L/K)^{\ab} \to A_K / \Norm_{M/K} A_M</m> is an isomorphism,
          so <m>r_{L/K}</m> must be injective.

      <title>Reciprocity law</title>

        <p>
          Under <xref ref="hypo-abstract-cft"/>, 
          for each Galois extension <m>L/K</m> of finite subextensions of <m>\kbar/k</m>,
          the homomorphism <m>r_{L/K}</m> from <xref ref="def-abstract-recip-final"/> induces an isomorphism
          <m>\Gal(L/K)^{\ab} \to A_K / \Norm_{L/K} A_L</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        The map in question is injective by <xref ref="lem-abstract-recip-case4"/>, so it only remains to check that
        <m>r_{L/K}</m> itself is surjective.
        If <m>L/K</m> is solvable, we may deduce surjectivity from <xref ref="lem-abstract-recip-case3"/> by induction on
        <m>[L:K]</m> again by a diagram chase on <xref ref="fig-abstractcft-1"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For general <m>L/K</m>, we instead check that <m>r_{L/K}</m> becomes a surjection upon restriction to <m>p</m>-Sylow
        subgroups for each prime <m>p</m>. That is, for <m>M</m> the fixed field of a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of 
        <m>\Gal(L/K)</m> and <m>S_p</m> the Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>A_K/\Norm_{L/K}A_L</m>, the composition
        <me>
          \Gal(L/M) \to \Gal(L/K) \stackrel{r_{L/K}}{\to} A_K/\Norm_{L/K} A_L \to S_p
        </me>
        is surjective. (Compare the proof of <xref ref="L_tate_thm_lemma"/>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Here some caution is required because <m>M/K</m> need not be Galois, 
        so we cannot draw the full diagram <xref ref="fig-abstractcft-1"/>.
        However, the left square in that diagram still makes sense and commutes.
        Meanwhile, we may apply the previous paragraph to see that the left vertical arrow <m>r_{L/M}</m>
        is an isomorphism. Now note that the composition <m>A_K \subseteq A_M \stackrel{\Norm_{M/K}}{\to} A_K</m> is multiplication by <m>[M:K]</m>,
        which is coprime to <m>p</m>; it follows that the bottom horizontal arrow induces a surjection of Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups. 
        (One can also apply <xref ref="P_abstract_functorialities2"/> here.)
      </p>
    </proof>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Alternatively, one can derive <xref ref="T_abstract_reciprocity_law"/> by an argument closer to what we did in local class field theory.
        In this approach, one first simulates the proofs of <xref ref="P_H2_upper_bound"/> and <xref ref="P_H2_lower_bound"/> to show that
        <m>H^2(\Gal(L/K), A_L)</m> is cyclic of order <m>[L:K]</m>; 
        the latter argument ends up being quite similar to the proof of <xref ref="lem-abstract-recip-case2"/>, with the role of Theorem 90 (<xref ref="L_theorem_90"/>)
        being played by the <m>H^{-1}_T</m> aspect of the class field axiom.
        One must then check that the reciprocity map agrees with the map given by Tate's theorem <xref ref="T_tate_thm2"/>; we leave the details to the interested reader,
        but see <xref ref="sec_connection"/> for a similar argument in the setting of global class field theory.
      </p>

    <p>
      This directly implies a version of the norm limitation theorem.

        <p>
          The only issue is the inclusion <m>\Norm_{M/K} A_M \subseteq \Norm_{L/K} A_L</m>, which we are free to check after enlarging <m>L</m>
          (as long as we do not change <m>M</m>). We may thus assume that <m>L/K</m> is Galois.

    <remark xml:id="rmk_abstract_existence">

        In a similar vein, note that every subgroup of <m>A_K</m> containing a subgroup of the form <m>\Norm_{M/K} A_M</m> for some finite extension <m>M/K</m> 
        must itself occur as <m>\Norm_{L/K} A_L</m> for some finite (and even abelian) extension <m>L/K</m>. 
        Consequently, proving an analogue of the existence theorem in this setting amounts to computing the intersection of the groups <m>\Norm_{M/K} A_M</m>.

      <p>
        Following <xref ref="bib-Neukirch"/>,

        One can then assert that <m>\Gal(K^{\ab}/K)</m> is isomorphic to the profinite completion of <m>A_K</m>, or equivalently its maximal Hausdorff quotient, 
        for the family of quotients by open subgroups in the norm topology.
