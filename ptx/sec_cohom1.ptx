        (We will generalize ourselves from finite to profinite groups a bit later on.)
        Warning: some authors (like Milne, and Neukirch for the most part)
        put group actions on the left and some (like Neukirch in chapter IV, and myself here)
        put them on the right. Of course, the theory is the same either way!

    <title>Caveat</title>
      <p>
        This material may seem a bit dry.
        If so, don't worry;
        only a small part of the theory will be relevant for class field theory.
        However, it doesn't make sense to learn that small part without knowing what it is a part of!
      </p>
      <p>
        The euphemism <q>abstract nonsense</q> in specific reference to category theory and/or homological algebra has been attributed to Norman Steenrod.
        It was used in a tongue-in-cheek manner without intending a negative connotation, although such a connotation has been imputed by later authors
        (a notable example being <xref ref="bib-Lang-algebra"/>).

    <title><m>G</m>-modules and their invariants</title>
    <definition>
      <p>
        Let <m>G</m> be a finite group.
        A <term>(right) <m>G</m>-module</term> is an abelian group <m>A</m> equipped with a right <m>G</m>-action.
        I'll write this action using superscripts, i.e., the image of the action of <m>g</m> on <m>m</m> is <m>m^g</m>.
        Alternatively, <m>A</m> can be viewed as a right module for the group algebra <m>\ZZ[G]</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
      A <term>homomorphism</term> of <m>G</m>-modules <m>\phi: M \to N</m> is a homomorphism of abelian groups that is compatible with the <m>G</m>-actions, i.e., <m>\phi(m^g) = \phi(m)^g</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <remark>
      For those keeping score, the category of <m>G</m>-modules is an example of an <term>abelian category</term>;
      that is, it is an <term>additive category</term> (meaning that the Hom sets have abelian group structures for which composition distributes over addition)
      with some extra properties related to kernels and cokernels of morphisms.
      The following discussion is specialized from the general theory of derived functors on abelian categories.
    </remark>
    <definition>
    <p>
      Given a <m>G</m>-module <m>M</m>,
      let <m>M^G</m> be the abelian group of <m>G</m>-invariant elements of <m>M</m>:
      <me>
        M^G = \{m \in M: m^g = m  \forall g \in G\}
      </me>.
      The functor <m>M \to M^G</m> from <m>G</m>-modules to abelian groups is <term>left exact</term> but not <term>right exact</term>.
      That is, say we start with an <term>exact sequence</term>
      <me>
      0 \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0
      </me>
      of <m>G</m>-modules; that is, the kernel of each map is equal to the image of the previous map. Then
      <me>
      0 \to (M')^G \to M^G \to (M'')^G
      </me>
      is again an exact sequence, but this need not remain true if we add 0 at the end; that is, the map
      <m>M^G \to (M'')^G</m> may not be surjective.
    </p>
    <p>
      More generally, if <m>0 \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0</m> is an exact sequence,
      then <m>0 \to (M')^G \to M^G \to (M'')^G</m> is exact,
    </p>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <p>
        Take the sequence <m>0 \to \ZZ/p\ZZ \to \ZZ/p^2\ZZ \to \ZZ/p\ZZ \to 0</m> of <m>G</m>-modules for <m>G = \ZZ/p\ZZ</m>, which acts on the middle factor by <m>a^g = a(1+pg)</m>.
        Then <m>M^G \to (M'')^G</m> is the zero map but <m>(M'')^G</m> is nonzero.)
      </p>

    <title>Injective objects and resolutions</title>
    <p>
      The topic of <term>homological algebra</term> provides a systematic way to quantify the difference between an exact functor and a left exact
      (or a right exact) functor. This rests on the following key concept.
    </p>
    <definition>
      A <m>G</m>-module <m>M</m> is <term>injective</term>
      if for every inclusion <m>A \subset B</m> of <m>G</m>-modules and every <m>G</m>-module homomorphism <m>\phi: A \to M</m>,
      there is a homomorphism <m>\psi: B \to M</m> that extends <m>\phi</m>.
    </definition>
    <lemma xml:id="L_enough_injectives">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Every <m>G</m>-module can be embedded into some injective <m>G</m>-module.
          In other words, the abelian category of <m>G</m>-modules <term>has enough injectives</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        See <xref ref="exer-enough-injectives"/>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <definition>
      <p>
        An <term>injective resolution</term> of a <m>G</m>-module <m>M</m> is an exact sequence
        <me>
          0 \to M \to I^0 \stackrel{d^0}{\to} I^1 \stackrel{d^1}{\to} \dots
        </me>
        in which the objects <m>I^0, I^1, \dots</m> are injective <m>G</m>-modules.
     </p>
      <p>
        From <xref ref="L_enough_injectives"/>, it follows that injective resolutions always exist.
        To wit, first embed <m>M</m> into an injective <m>G</m>-module <m>I^0</m>,
        then embed <m>I^0/M</m> into an injective <m>G</m>-module <m>I^1</m>, and so on.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <definition xml:id="def-derived-functor">
    <p>
      Starting with an injective resolution of <m>M</m>, apply the functor of <m>G</m>-invariants; the result
      <me>
        0 \to (I^0)^G \stackrel{d^0}{\to} (I^1)^G \stackrel{d^1}{\to} \dots
      </me>
      is still a <term>complex</term> in the sense that any two consecutive maps compose to zero, but it is not necessarily exact.
      (That is, we still have inclusions <m>\im(d^i) \subseteq \ker(d^{i+1})</m>, but these need not be equalities.)
      We turn this failure into success by defining the <m>i</m>-th <term>cohomology group</term> as the quotient
      <me>
        H^i(G, M) = \ker(d^i)/\im(d^{i-1}),
      </me>
      with the temporary proviso that this appears to depend not just on <m>M</m> but also on the injective resolution.
      By convention, we let <m>d^{-1}</m> be the map
      <m>0 \to I_0^G</m>, so <m>H^0(G,M)=M^G</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given a homomorphism <m>f: M \to N</m> and another injective resolution <m>0 \to N \to J_0 \to J_1 \to \cdots</m>,
      <xref ref="L_enough_injectives"/> again implies the existence of a commutative diagram as in <xref ref="fig-cohom1-1"/>
      with exact rows. When we apply the functor of <m>G</m>-invariants, we again get a commutative diagram, but the rows are only
      complexes rather than exact sequences. However, the vertical arrows in the resulting diagram induce maps
      <m>H^i(f): H^i(G, M) \to H^i(G, N)</m>.

    <title>Right derived functors</title>
    <p>
      Continuing the thread, we observe the following.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="L_injective_resolutions_to_cohomology_maps">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For a fixed choice of the injective resolutions of <m>M</m> and <m>N</m> in <xref ref="def-derived-functor"/>,
          the map <m>H^i(f)</m> does not depend on the choice of the <m>f_i</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        This proof is a standard example of <q>abstract nonsense</q>. It suffices to check that if <m>f=0</m>,
        then the <m>H^i(f)</m> are all zero regardless of what the <m>f_i</m> are.
        In that case, it turns out one can construct maps <m>g_i: I_{i+1} \to J_i</m>
        (and by convention <m>g_{-1} = 0</m>)
        such that <m>f_i = g_i \circ d_i + d_{i-1} \circ g_{i-1}</m>,
        as illustrated in <xref ref="fig-cohom1-2"/>. (Beware that this figure is not a commutative diagram!)
        Details left as an exercise (see <xref ref="exer-resolutions-to-maps"/>).

        The diagonal arrows depicted in <xref ref="fig-cohom1-2"/> with the property described in the proof of <xref ref="L_injective_resolutions_to_cohomology_maps"/>
        (namely, that <m>f_i = g_i \circ d_i + d_{i-1} \circ g_{i-1}</m>), are collectively called a <term>chain homotopy</term> for the map <m>f</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <definition>
    <p>
      We can now close the books on <xref ref="def-derived-functor"/> as follows.
      If <m>M=N</m> and <m>f</m> is the identity,
      we get a canonical map between
      <m>H^i(G,M)</m> and <m>H^i(G,N)</m> for each <m>i</m>.
      That is, the groups <m>H^i(G,M)</m> are well-defined independent of the choice of the injective resolution.
      Likewise, the map <m>H^i(f)</m> is also independent of the choice of resolutions, so each <m>H^i</m> defines a functor from
      <m>G</m>-modules to abelian groups. These are called the <term>right derived functors</term> of the functor of <m>G</m>-invariants.
    </p>
    </definition>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
      Given a short exact sequence <m>0 \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0</m> of <m>G</m>-modules,
      there is a canonical long exact sequence of abelian groups
      <me>
        0 \to H^0(G, M') \to \cdots \to H^i(G, M'') \stackrel{\delta_i}{\to} H^{i+1}(G, M') \to H^{i+1}(G, M) \to H^{i+1}(G,M'') \to \cdots

      <title>Snake Lemma</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given a commuting diagram as in <xref ref="fig-cohom1-3"/> with exact rows,
          there is a canonical map <m>\delta: \ker(f_2) \to \coker(f_0)</m> such that the sequence

          is exact.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      The key point is to define the map <m>\delta</m>, as the rest amounts to <q>diagram chasing</q>.
      To wit, given <m>x \in \ker(f_2) \subseteq M_2</m>,
      lift <m>x</m> to <m>M_1</m>, push it into <m>N_1</m> by <m>f_1</m>,
      then check that the image has a preimage in <m>N_0</m>.
      Verification that this is well-defined (and a homomorphism), and that everything is exact, is left to the reader.
      (Aside: the snake lemma is depicted in the movie <url href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etbcKWEKnvg"><pubtitle>It's My Turn</pubtitle></url>,
      but not in any more detail than we have given here.)
   </proof>
   <remark xml:id="rmk-universal-delta-functors">
     In modern algebra, it is common to define objects (e.g., tensor products of modules) in terms of <q>universal properties</q> that they satisfy.
     This can be done for derived functors via the theory of <term><m>\delta</m>-functors</term>, as introduced in <xref ref="bib-Grothendieck-Tohoku"/>.

   <title>Additional comments</title>
    <p>
      One important consequence of the long exact sequence is that if
      <m>0 \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0</m> is a short exact sequence of <m>G</m>-modules and <m>H^1(G, M') = 0</m>,
      then <m>0 \to (M')^G \to M^G \to (M'')^G \to 0</m> is also exact.
    </p>
    <p>
      More abstract nonsense:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>0 \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0</m> is a short exact sequence of <m>G</m>-modules and <m>H^i(G, M) = 0</m> for all <m>i>0</m>,
            then the connecting homomorphisms in the long exact sequence induce isomorphisms <m>H^i(G, M'') \to H^{i+1}(G, M')</m> for all <m>i > 0</m>
            (and a surjection for <m>i=0</m>).
            This sometimes allows one to prove general facts by proving them first for <m>H^0</m>,
            where they have a direct interpretation, then
            <q>dimension shifting</q>; however, getting from <m>H^0</m> to <m>H^1</m> typically requires some extra attention.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>M</m> is an injective <m>G</m>-module,
            then <m>H^i(G,M) = 0</m> for all <m>i>0</m>.
            (Use <m>0 \to M \to M \to 0 \to \cdots</m> as an injective resolution.)
            This fact has a sort of converse: see next bullet.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We say <m>M</m> is <term>acyclic</term>
            if <m>H^i(G,M) =0</m> for all <m>i>0</m>;
            so in particular, injective <m>G</m>-modules are acyclic.
            It turns out that we can replace the injective resolution in the definition by an acyclic resolution for the purposes of doing a computation;
            see <xref ref="exer-acyclic-res"/>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, the abstract nature of the proofs so far gives us almost no insight into what the objects are that we've just constructed.
      We'll remedy that next time by giving more concrete descriptions that one can actually compute with.
