    <title>Caveat</title>
    <p>
      The Galois cohomology groups used in <xref ref="bib-Neukirch"/> are not the ones we defined earlier,
      but rather the Tate cohomology groups we are going to define below.
    </p>

    <title>Homology</title>
    <p>
      You may not be surprised to learn that there is a <q>dual</q> theory to the theory of group cohomology, namely group homology.
      What you may be surprised to learn is that one can actually fit the two together,
      so that in a sense the homology groups become cohomology groups with negative indices.
      (Since the arguments are similar to those for cohomology, I'm going to skip some details.)
    </p>
    <definition>
      Let <m>M_G</m> denote the maximal quotient of <m>M</m> on which <m>G</m> acts trivially.
      In other words,
      <m>M_G</m> is the quotient of <m>M</m> by the submodule spanned by <m>m^g-m</m> for all <m>m \in M</m> and <m>g \in G</m>.
      In yet other words, <m>M_G = M/M I_G</m>,
      where <m>I_G</m> is the <term>augmentation ideal</term>
      of the group algebra <m>\ZZ[G]</m>:
      <me>
        I_G = \left\{\sum_{g \in G} z_g[g]: \sum_g z_g = 0\right\}
      </me>.
    </definition>
    <p>
      Or if you like, <m>M_G = M \otimes_{\ZZ[G]} \ZZ</m>.
      Since <m>M^G</m> is the group of <m>G</m>-invariants,
      we call <m>M_G</m> the group of
      <term><m>G</m>-coinvariants</term>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The functor <m>M \to M^G</m> is right exact but not left exact:
      if <m>0 \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0</m>,
      then <m>M'_G \to M_G \to M''_G \to 0</m> is exact but the map on the left is not injective.
      Again, we can fill in the exact sequence by defining homology groups.
    </p>
    <definition>
      A <m>G</m>-module <m>M</m> is <term>projective</term>
      if for any surjection <m>N \to N'</m> of <m>G</m>-modules and any map <m>\phi: M \to N'</m>,
      there exists a map <m>\psi: M \to N</m> lifting <m>\phi</m>.
      This definition is dual to the definition of an injective <m>G</m>-module, but this symmetry is a bit misleading:
      it is much easier to find projectives than injectives.
      For example,  any <m>G</m>-module which is a free module over the ring <m>\ZZ[G]</m> is projective
      such as <m>\ZZ[G]</m> itself!
    </definition>
    <definition>
    <p>
      A <term>projective resolution</term> of <m>M</m> is an exact sequence
      <m>\cdots \to P_1 \to P_0 \to M \to 0</m> of <m>G</m>-modules
      in which the <m>P_i</m> are projective.
      Given such a resolution,
      take coinvariants to get a complex
      <me>
        \cdots \stackrel{d_2}{\to} P_2 \stackrel{d_1}{\to} P_1 \stackrel{d_0}{\to} P_0 \to 0
      </me>,
      then put <m>H_i(G, M) = \ker(d_{i-1})/\im(d_i)</m>.
      Again, this is canonically independent of the resolution and functorial,
      and there is a long exact sequence which starts out
      <me>
        \cdots \to H_1(G, M'') \stackrel{\delta}{\to} H_0(G, M') \to H_0(G, M) \to H_0(G, M'') \to 0.
      </me>
    </p>
    </definition>
    <definition>
    <p>
      We say that <m>M</m> is <term>acyclic (for homology)</term> if 
      <m>H_i(G,M) =0</m> for <m>i>0</m>.
      As with group cohomology, we can replace a projective resolution with an acyclic resolution and get the same homology groups.
      For example, induced modules are again acyclic and the analogue of Shapiro's lemma holds
      (key point: any free <m>\ZZ[H]</m>-module induces to a free <m>\ZZ[G]</m>-module).
    </p>
    </definition>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-first-homology">
    <p>
      One can give a concrete description of homology as well,
      but we won't need it for our purposes.
      Even without one, though,
      we can calculate <m>H_1(G, \ZZ)</m>, using the exact sequence
      <me>
        0 \to I_G \to \ZZ[G] \to \ZZ \to 0
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the long exact sequence in homology,
      <me>
        0 = H_1(G, \ZZ[G]) \to H_1(G, \ZZ) \to H_0(G, I_G) \to H_0(G, \ZZ[G])
      </me>
      is exact, i.e.
      <m>0 \to H_1(G, \ZZ) \to I_G/I_G^2 \to \ZZ[G]/I_G</m> is exact.
      The last map is induced by
      <m>I_G \hookrightarrow \ZZ[G]</m> and so is the zero map.
      Thus <m>H_1(G, \ZZ) \cong I_G/I_G^2</m>;
      recall that in <xref ref="exc-augmentation"/>,
      it was shown that the map <m>g \mapsto [g] - 1</m> defines an isomorphism <m>G^{\ab} \to I_G/I_G^2</m>.
      This can be thought of as an algebraic analogue of the fact that the first homology group of a (reasonable)
      topological space equals the abelianization of the fundamental group.

    <title>The Tate groups</title>
    <p>
      We now
      <q>fit together</q>
      the long exact sequences of cohomology and homology to get a doubly infinite exact sequence.
    </p>
    <definition>
    <p>
      Let <m>M</m> be a <m>G</m>-module.
      Define the map <m>\Norm_G: M \to M</m> by
      <me>
        \Norm_G(m) = \sum_{g \in G} m^g
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then <m>\Norm_G</m> induces a homomorphism
      <me>
        \Norm_G: H_0(G,M) = M_G \to M^G = H^0(G,M)
      </me>.
    </p>
    </definition>
    <remark>
    <p>
    You might be wondering why <m>\Norm_G</m> is called a <q>norm</q> rather than a <q>trace</q>.
    The reason is that in practice, our modules <m>M</m> will most often be groups which are most naturally written
     multiplicatively, e.g., the nonzero elements of a field.
     </p>
    </remark>
    <definition>
    <p>
      We now define the <term>Tate cohomology groups</term> (or <term>Tate homology groups</term> if you prefer) as follows:
      <me>
        H_T^i = \begin{cases}H^i(G, M) \amp  i > 0 \\ M^G/\Norm_G M \amp  i=0 \\ \ker(\Norm_G)/MI_G \amp  i=-1 \\ H_{-i-1}(G,M) \amp  i\lt -1. \end{cases}
      </me>
    </p>
    </definition>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
      <p>
      For any short exact sequence
      <m>0 \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0</m> of <m>G</m>-modules, we have a canonical exact sequence
      <me>
        \cdots \to H^{i-1}_T(G, M'') \to H^i_T(G, M') \to H^i_T(G, M) \to H^i_T(G, M'') \to H^{i+1}_T(G, M') \to \cdots
      </me>
      which extends infinitely in both directions.
      </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        Since we already have long exact sequences for homology and cohomology, the only remaining issue is exactness between
        <m>H^{-2}_T(G, M'')</m> and <m>H^1_T(G, M')</m> inclusive.
        This follows by diagram-chasing, as in the proof of the snake lemma (<xref ref="L_snake_lemma"/>)
        on the commutative diagram <xref ref="fig-homology-1"/>
        with exact rows, noting that the diagram remains commutative with the dashed arrows added.

    <title>Finite cyclic groups</title>
    <p>
      In general, for any given <m>G</m> and <m>M</m>,
      it is at worst a tedious exercise to compute
      <m>H^i_T(G,M)</m> for any single value of <m>i</m>,
      but try to compute all of these at once and you discover that they exhibit very little evident structure.
      Thankfully, there is an exception to that dreary rule when <m>G</m> is cyclic.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="T_cyclic_group_periodicity">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> be a finite cyclic group and <m>M</m> a <m>G</m>-module.
          Then there is a canonical
          (up to the choice of a generator of <m>G</m>),
          functorial isomorphism <m>H^i_T(G,M) \to H^{i+2}_T(G,M)</m> for all <m>i \in \ZZ</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Choose a generator <m>g</m> of <m>G</m>.
        We start with the four-term exact sequence of <m>G</m>-modules
        <me>
          0 \to \ZZ \to \ZZ[G] \to \ZZ[G] \to \ZZ \to 0
        </me>
        in which the first map is <m>1 \mapsto \sum_{g \in G} [g]</m>,
        the second map is <m>[h] \mapsto [hg] - [h]</m>,
        and the third map is <m>[h] \mapsto 1</m>.
        Since everything in sight is a free abelian group,
        we can tensor over <m>\ZZ</m> with <m>M</m> and get another exact sequence:
        <me>
          0 \to M \to M \otimes_\ZZ \ZZ[G] \to M \otimes_\ZZ \ZZ[G] \to M \to 0
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terms in the middle are just <m>\Ind^G_{1} M</m>,
        where we first restrict <m>M</m> to a module for the trivial group and then induce back up.
        Thus their Tate groups are all zero.
        The desired result now follows from the following general fact: if
        <me>
          0 \to A \stackrel{f}{\to} B \stackrel{g}{\to} C \stackrel{h}{\to} D \to 0
        </me>
        is exact and <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> have all Tate groups zero,
        then there is a canonical isomorphism <m>H^{i+2}_T(G, A) \to H^i_T(G, D)</m>.
        To see this,
        apply the long exact sequence to the short exact sequences
        <md>
          <mrow>0 \to A \to B \to B/\im(f) \to 0</mrow>
          <mrow>0 \to B/\ker(g) \to C \to D \to 0</mrow>
        </md>
        to get
        <me>
          H^{i+2}(G, A) \cong H^{i+1}(G, B/\im(f)) = H^{i+1}(G, B/\ker(g)) \cong H^i(G,D)
        </me>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <remark>
    <p>
      In particular, when <m>G</m> is cyclic, the long exact sequence of a short exact sequence
      <m>0 \to M' \to M \to M'' \to 0</m> of <m>G</m>-modules curls up into an exact hexagon
      as in <xref ref="fig-homology-2"/>.

    <definition>
    <p>
      Let <m>G</m> be a finite cyclic group and let <m>M</m> be a <m>G</m>-module.
      If the groups <m>H^i_T(G, M)</m> are finite,
      we define the <term>Herbrand quotient</term> as the ratio
      <me>
        h(M) = \#H^0_T(G,M) / \#H^{-1}_T(G, M).
      </me>
      From the exactness of the hexagon in <xref ref="fig-homology-2"/>,
      we see that if <m>M', M, M''</m> all have Herbrand quotients, then
      <me>
        h(M) = h(M') h(M'').
      </me>
    </p>
    </definition>
    <remark>
      Expanding on the previous point, if two of <m>M', M, M''</m> have Herbrand quotients, then so does the third.
      For example, if <m>M'</m> and <m>M''</m> have Herbrand quotients,
      i.e., their Tate groups are finite,
      then we have an exact sequence
      <me>
        H^{-1}_T(G, M') \to H^{-1}_T(G, M) \to H^{-1}_T(G, M'')
      </me>
      and the outer groups are all finite.
      In particular,
      the first map is out of a finite group and so has finite image,
      and modulo that image,
      <m>H^{-1}_T(G,M)</m> injects into another finite group.
      So it's also finite, and so on.
    </remark>
    <remark>
    <p>
      In practice,
      it will often be much easier to compute the Herbrand quotient of a <m>G</m>-module than to compute either of its Tate groups directly.
      The Herbrand quotient will then do half of the work for free:
      once one group is computed directly,
      at least the order of the other will be automatically known.
    </p>
    </remark>
    <remark>
    <p>
      If <m>M</m> is finite, then <m>h(M) = 1</m>.
      To wit, the sequences
      <md>
        <mrow>0 \to M^G \to M \to M \to M_G \to 0</mrow>
        <mrow>0 \to H^{-1}_T(G,M) \to M_G \stackrel{\Norm_G}{\to} M^G \to H^0_T(G,M) \to 0</mrow>
      </md>
      are exact, where <m>M \to M</m> is the map <m>m \mapsto m^g - m</m>;
      thus <m>M_G</m> and <m>M^G</m> have the same order,
      as do <m>H^{-1}_T</m> and <m>H^0_T</m>.

    <title>Extended functoriality revisited</title>
    <p>
      The extended functoriality for cohomology groups (<xref ref="D-extended-functoriality"/>) has analogues for homology groups and Tate cohomology groups,
      but under more restrictive conditions.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="D-extended-functoriality-homology">
    <p>
      Again, let <m>M</m> be a <m>G</m>-module and <m>M'</m> a <m>G'</m>-module,
      and consider a homomorphism
      <m>\alpha: G' \to G</m> of groups and a homomorphism
      <m>\beta: M \to M'</m> of abelian which are compatible in the sense of <xref ref="D-extended-functoriality"/>.
      We would like to obtain canonical homomorphisms
      <m>H_i(G, M) \to H_i(G', M')</m>,
      but for this we need to add an additional condition to ensure that
      <m>M \to M'</m> induces a well-defined map <m>M_G \to M'_{G'}</m>.
      For instance, this holds if <m>\alpha</m> is surjective.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Tate cohomology groups, there is a further complication that the map <m>M^G \to (M')^{G'}</m> does not necessarily induce
      a map <m>\Norm(M) \to \Norm(M')</m>. However, this does occur if <m>\alpha</m> is injective, so for instance we have well-defined
      restriction maps <m>\Res: H^0_T(G, M) \to H^0_T(H, M)</m> whenever <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.
    </p>
    </definition>
    <remark xml:id="rmk-torsion-H0T">
      <p>
        In <xref ref="exa-extended-functoriality"/>, we used the restriction and corestriction maps to show that for <m>G</m> a finite group and
        <m>M</m> a <M>G</M>-module, the groups <m>H^i(G, M)</m> are torsion groups killed by <m>\#G</m> for all <m>i > 0</m>.
        While we cannot extend the corestriction map to Tate cohomology, we may still argue directly that <m>H^0_T(G, M)</m> is killed by <m>\#G</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      While <xref ref="D-extended-functoriality-homology"/> does not yield inflation maps for Tate groups, we can obtain the following 
      variant of the inflation-restriction exact sequence by dimension shifting.
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lem-inflation-restriction-H0">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>H</m> be a normal subgroup of a finite group <m>G</m> and <m>M</m> a <m>G</m>-module.
          If <m>H^0_T(G/H, M^H) = 0</m>, then <m>\Res: H^0_T(G,M) \stackrel{\Res}{\to} H^0_T(H,M)</m> is injective.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Choose <m>N</m> so that <m>0 \to N \to \Ind^G_{1} M \to M \to 0</m> is exact (where again
        <m>\Ind^G_1 M \to M</m> is the map <m>m \otimes [g] \mapsto m^g</m>);
        then by the usual inflation-restriction exact sequence (<xref ref="P_inflation_restriction"/>),
        <me>
          0 \to H^1_T(G/H, N^H) \stackrel{\Inf}{\to} H^1_T(G,N) \stackrel{\Res}{\to} H^1_T(H,N)
        </me>
        is exact.
        Now <m>\Ind^G_{1} M</m> is acyclic for <m>G</m> and for <m>H</m>,
        and <m>(\Ind^G_1 M)^H</m> is acyclic for <m>G/H</m>.
        Moreover, if we take <m>H</m>-invariants, we have an exact sequence
        <me>
          0 \to N^H \to (\Ind^G_1 M)^H \to M^H \to 0;
        </me>
        namely, exactness on the right holds because any
        <m>m \in M^H</m> lifts to <m>m \otimes [1] \in (\Ind^G_1 M)^H</m>.
        Using long exact sequences,
        we now see first that <m>H^1_T(G/H, N^H) = H^0_T(G/H, M^H) = 0</m>,
        then deduce that <m>\Res: H^1_T(G,N) \to H^1_T(H,N)</m> is injective,
        then finally deduce the desired result.

          Use the fact that induced <m>G</m>-modules are acyclic for both cohomology and homology to reduce to checking the cases <m>i = -1, 0</m>.
          Another option is to extend Shapiro's lemma to Tate cohomology groups.</p>

          The periodicity of the Tate groups for <m>G</m> cyclic means that there is a canonical
          (up to the choice of a generator of <m>G</m>)
          isomorphism between <m>H^{-1}_T(G, M)</m> and <m>H^1_T(G,M)</m>,
          i.e., between <m>\ker(\Norm_G)/MI_G</m> and the set of equivalence classes of 1-cocycles.
          What is this isomorphism explicitly?
          In other words, given an element of <m>\ker(\Norm_G)/MI_G</m>,
          what is the corresponding 1-cocycle?

          Put <m>K = \QQ_p(\sqrt{p})</m>.
          Compute the Herbrand quotient of <m>K^*</m> as a <m>G</m>-module for <m>G = \Gal(\QQ_p(\sqrt{p})/\QQ_p)</m>.

        <statement>
          Let <m>G \subseteq H</m> be an inclusion of finite groups.
          Show that via the identification from <xref ref="rmk-first-homology"/>,
          the map <m>\Res: H^{-2}_T(G, \ZZ) \to H^{-2}_T(H,\ZZ)</m> corresponds to the transfer (Verlagerung) map <m>V: G^{\ab} \to H^{\ab}</m>.
          This provides another way to derive the existence of the latter.
